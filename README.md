At the moment, we only use the text modality to correctly classify the emotion of the utterances.The experiments were carried out on two datasets (i.e. MELD and IEMOCAP)

## Prerequisites

- An x86-64 Unix or Unix-like machine
- Python 3.7 or higher
- [`multimodal-datasets` repo](https://github.com/tae898/multimodal-datasets) (submodule)

## RoBERTa training

First configure the hyper parameters and the dataset in `train-erc-text.yaml` and then,
In this directory run the below commands. I recommend you to run this in a virtualenv.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train-erc-text.py
```

This will subsequently call `train-erc-text-hp.py` and `train-erc-text-full.py`.

## Results on the test split (weighted f1 scores)

| Model    |                                          |      MELD      |     IEMOCAP    |
|----------|------------------------------------------|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| EmoBERTa | No past and future utterances            |      63.46     |      56.09     |
|          | Only past utterances                     |      64.55     |    **68.57**   |
|          | Only future utterances                   |      64.23     |      66.56     |
|          | Both past and future utterances          |    **65.61**   |      67.42     |
|          | â†’ *without speaker names*            |      65.07     |      64.02     |

Above numbers are the mean values of five random seed runs.
