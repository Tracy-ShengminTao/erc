There are no speaker label. I assume that the two speakers are taking turns.
That is, every utterance spoken by speaker A is followed by another utterance
followed by speaker B.

This data has too many redundant white spaces before and after some special characters
, such as ['!', '%', ')', ',', '.', ':', ';', '?', '’', '”', '′'] and ['"', '#', '(', '@', '°', '‘', '“', '′', '’']. Many of them were removed.
