# MELD

This directory includes jupyter notebooks. They are pretty much self-explanatory.

## Jupyter notebooks.

- `1.smaller-datasets.ipynb` is to generate smaller datasets from the original datasets. Just ignore this. We don't do this anymore.
-  `2.visual-features-extraction.ipynb` is to extract all of the visual features that are deemed necessary. This takes a lot of of time.
- `3.visual-features-check.ipynb` is to qualitatively see if the extracted visual features are correct or not.
- `4.find-relevant-faces.ipynb` is to run clustering (unsupervised) on the face embedding vectors to find the faces we want.
- `5.dataset-stats.ipynb` is to see the stats of the datasets.
