CHANDLER: also I was the point person on my company’s transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
THE INTERVIEWER: You must’ve had your hands full.
CHANDLER: That I did. That I did.
THE INTERVIEWER: So let’s talk a little bit about your duties.
CHANDLER: My duties?  All right.
THE INTERVIEWER: Now you’ll be heading a whole division, so you’ll have a lot of duties.
CHANDLER: I see.
THE INTERVIEWER: But there’ll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.
CHANDLER: Good to know.
THE INTERVIEWER: We can go into detail
CHANDLER: No don’t I beg of you!
THE INTERVIEWER: All right then, we’ll have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, you’ll fit in well here.
CHANDLER: Really?!
THE INTERVIEWER: Absolutely.  You can relax
JOEY: But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?
RACHEL: You know? Forget it!

PHOEBE: Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
CHANDLER: What, what, what?!
PHOEBE: What?!
PHOEBE: He was with her when he wrote this poem.
PHOEBE: Look,  'My vessel so empty with nothing inside.
PHOEBE: Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.'
PHOEBE: He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
PHOEBE: Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
JOEY: Done.
RACHEL: Hey!

RACHEL: What are you doing here?
ROSS: Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
RACHEL: Oh.
ROSS: Hi.
RACHEL: Hi.
ROSS: How’d did it go?
RACHEL: Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn’t shut up.
ROSS: I’m so proud of you.
RACHEL: Me too!
ROSS: Listen, I’m ah, I’m sorry I’ve been so crazy and jealous and, it’s just that I like you a lot, so...

CHANDLER: Oh-ho-ho, yeah!
JOEY: Which part exactly?
CHANDLER: The whole thing! Can we go?
JOEY: Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
CHANDLER: I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
JOEY: Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?
CHANDLER: I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
JOEY: You fell asleep!!
JOEY: There was no kangaroo!
JOEY: They didn’t take any of my suggestions!
JOEY: That’s for coming buddy.
JOEY: I’ll see you later.
CHANDLER: Don’t go!
CHANDLER: I’m sorry.
CHANDLER: I’m so sorry!
CHANDLER: Look!
CHANDLER: This guy fell asleep!
CHANDLER: He fell asleep too!
CHANDLER: Be mad at him!
CHANDLER: Or, call an ambulance.
JOEY: Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
ROSS: What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
PHOEBE: Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring.
PHOEBE: See, if I’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity

CUSTOMER: I don’t know.  Let me see the ring.
CHANDLER: Great! Okay, here.
CUSTOMER: All right.
CHANDLER: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!  And
CHANDLER: What've you been up to?
JADE: Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much.
JADE: Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
CHANDLER: Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.  I love her.
ROSS: I know.
CHANDLER: I'm back.
JADE: So, are we gonna get together or what?
CHANDLER: Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
JADE: Great, I'll see you then.
CHANDLER: Ok.  Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
ROSS: Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "Hey, you're not Bob."
CHANDLER: I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
ROSS: Oh my god. You are pure evil.
CHANDLER: Ok, pure evil , horny and alone . I've done this
PHOEBE: Nobody!
PHOEBE: Nobody respects the bucket!
PHOEBE: You wouldn't believe what people put in here!
PHOEBE: Look!
PHOEBE: Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?

JOEY: Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I’ll have my health insurance back in no time.
CHANDLER: That’s great, but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?
JOEY: What?!
CHANDLER: What’s wrong with you?
JOEY: Nothing!
JOEY: Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since.
JOEY: But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.
CHANDLER: This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you go to the doctor!
JOEY: No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
CHANDLER: That’s a hernia.
JOEY: Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!
MONA: I love your place! Where is this guy from?
ROSS: Uh that’s an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
MONA: Oh wow! So, you’re more than just dinosaurs.
ROSS: So much more.
ROSS: Well, well to sum up, we’re having fun, you look young.
MONA: Okay
ROSS: But that’s not enough. So… So…here’s a key to my apartment.
MONA: Really?!
ROSS: Really.
MONA: You don’t think this is too fast.
ROSS: Get Out!
CHARLIE: Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?
ROSS: Yes, please!  So, what's going on?
CHARLIE: Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.
ROSS: Oh my God, wh-what happened?
CHARLIE: Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!
ROSS: I knew that was him!
CHARLIE: Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.
ROSS: Hey, you ok?
CHARLIE: I guess.
CHARLIE: There was hum...  there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey.
CHARLIE: I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone  else.
PALEONTOLOGIST: Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.
ROSS: Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.
CHARLIE: Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?
PROFESSORE CLERK: Or we could throw you both in
ROSS: Ok, gentlemen!
ROSS: Please!
ROSS: Aren't we a little old for this?
ROSS: I mean, we're scientists, right?
ROSS: We're academics.
ROSS: And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first.
ROSS: GO, GO, GO!
ROSS: Go, go, go!
RACHEL: Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
PHOEBE: Oy!!
MONICA: What’s with all this sand?
PHOEBE: Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
ROSS: Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
JOEY: Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
JOEY: Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
CHANDLER: If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
MONICA: Rach? What are you doing?
RACHEL: Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
MONICA: It's a diaper commercial.
RACHEL: Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
CAITLIN: Pizza delivery!
ROSS: I'll get it! I will get that!
CAITLIN: Hi!
ROSS: Hi!
ROSS: Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
JOEY: Uhh, the ball thing.
ROSS: Yeah?
JOEY: Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
ROSS: Uhh,
JOEY: Okay!
JOEY: Uh-oh.
ROSS: What?
JOEY: I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!

PHOEBE: Yay!! Oh so, you’re not, you’re not mad at us anymore?
JOEY: No!
JOEY: No!
JOEY: No!
JOEY: You guys were totally right!
JOEY: This is so much better than the first time we went out.
JOEY: Y’know?
JOEY: That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
PHOEBE: Didn’t you sleep together?
JOEY: Yeah, that really calms me down.
JOEY: And!
JOEY: We have so much in common!
JOEY: She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if we were ever to have kids, well that’s a
RACHEL: Oh my God! Listen to you talkin’ about having kids. Oh my Joey.  Oh, please don’t get married before I do.
JOEY: Okay.
MONICA: How does she do that?
ROSS: I cannot sleep in a public place.
MONICA: Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
PHOEBE: Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
ROSS: It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
MONICA: What's going on with you?
PHOEBE: I got no sleep last night!
ROSS: Why?
PHOEBE: My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed.
PHOEBE: Oh, and deaf.
PHOEBE: So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time.
PHOEBE: You have no idea how loud they are!
MONICA: Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
PHOEBE: Thanks.
JOEY: Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
NURSE: It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
JOEY: Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
NURSE: Breathe, breathe, breathe.
MONICA: Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he’s actually going to kill you dead.
CHANDLER: Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?
PHOEBE: How can you not know which one?
RACHEL: I mean that’s unbelievable.
MONICA: I mean, was it Gina?
ROSS: Which one is Gina?
RACHEL: Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
MONICA: No, no, no, that’s Dina.
CHANDLER: You see you can’t tell which one is which either, dwha!!
RACHEL: I don’t know, you thought ‘See you Saturday’ was funny.
RACHEL: Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with.
RACHEL: You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
ROSS: Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
RACHEL: Really!?
ROSS: Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out.
ROSS: I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
RACHEL: Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me.  What?
ROSS: What should I wear, now I’m all nervous.
MR. TREEGER: : I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
JOEY: I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
MR. TREEGER: : Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, . Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball.
JOEY: Oh well, okay, good luck.
MR. TREEGER: : Yeah.
JOEY: Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
MR. TREEGER: : Ahh, thanks but no. You see I-I think I’m ready to dance with girls.
JOEY: Okay.
MR. TREEGER: : Yeah.
JOEY: Go get ‘em Treeger.
MR. TREEGER: : Right.  Hey, ahh, you wanna come? Marge has a girlfriend.
JOEY: Really?
MR. TREEGER: : Yeah, you could dance real good with her, she’s the same size as me.
JOEY: No, I’m good.
ROSS: Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
JOEY: Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so
CAROL: Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
JOEY: Who knows?
THE CASTING DIRECTOR: Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
ROSS: Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!
JOEY: Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
ROSS: Yeah!
THE CASTING DIRECTOR: Actually, that can't happen.
THE CASTING DIRECTOR: Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.
THE CASTING DIRECTOR: So it'll be either you two  or you two.
JOEY: Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
ROSS: Yeah, it is.
ROSS: No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
MONICA: Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
CHANDLER: Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
ROSS: Please!
ROSS: Are you kidding?
ROSS: I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose—I mean I-I’m not proud of it but, I really am.
ROSS: And it’s all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
EMILY: I think you’ve got concussion.
ROSS: No, no, I’m serious. Thank you.
EMILY: You’re welcome.  I’m sorry. Did I hurt you?
ROSS: It’s worth the pain.  Y’know what, you know what? It’s not.
MONICA: Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
CHANDLER: I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do"  "I do".
MONICA: Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
CHANDLER: David is going to propose to Phoebe.
MONICA: What?  Why?
MONICA: Chandler, we have talked about this.
MONICA: You are not supposed to give people advice!
MONICA: Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
CHANDLER: I
MONICA: They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike!
MONICA: She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone
CHANDLER: Man, that's some
ROSS: Oh, that's not what you want...
ELIZABETH: This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
ROSS: It-it’s great to meet you Paul.
PAUL: I usually prefer Elizabeth’s boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
ROSS: Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
PAUL: So Ross, what your problem?
ROSS: Eh-wh—Excuse me?
PAUL: Why can’t you get a girlfriend your own age?
ROSS: That’s funny. Umm….  It’s not funny.
PAUL: I
ROSS: Okay.
ROSS: I can, I can see that.
ROSS: Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.
PAUL: Okay.
ROSS: What?
PAUL: Okay. I’ll give you one chance to change my mind.  You got one minute.
ELIZABETH: Daddy!
JOEY: Oh well, it’s not on TV yet.
THE DRY CLEANER: Well, then it’s not on the wall yet.
JOEY: Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?
PHOEBE: So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer’s clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven’t been cleaned yet?
JOEY AND CHANDLER: Ooooohh!
PHOEBE: Oh yeah, I'm sure.  And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
MONICA: Was it...?
PHOEBE: Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
RACHEL: "Ooo," what?
PHOEBE: Uma Thurman.
MONICA: Oh!
ROSS: The actress!
ROSS: Thanks Rach.
CHANDLER: So what are you gonna do?
ROSS: You have to tell her!
ROSS: You have to tell her!
ROSS: It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue!
ROSS: Guys?
ROSS: Guys?
CHANDLER: Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
JOEY: Feminist issue. That's where I went!
PHOEBE: She is gonna hate me.
ROSS: Yeah, well...
CHANDLER: Will you marry me?
JOEY: It’s the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
ROSS: Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
CHANDLER: Yeah, right here in my pocket.  Pheebs?

RACHEL: Now, I'm just letting you know that this is
ROSS: Yep! That's hilarious!
RACHEL: I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
ROSS: Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
RACHEL: No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
ROSS: Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
RACHEL: Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
ROSS: What?! You totally get embarrassed!
RACHEL: No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
ROSS: Is that so?
RACHEL: Yeah.
ROSS: Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am
PHOEBE: I can’t believe it!
PHOEBE: I did it!
PHOEBE: I rode a bike!
PHOEBE: I never thought I’d be able to do that!
PHOEBE: Thank you Ross.
ROSS: Oh hey, don’t thank me, thank yourself. You’re the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
ROSS: Hey, both you guys should be up there with me.
ROSS: I mean, you two are-are my… I mean, I’m lucky to have just one good
CHANDLER: Thanks man.
JOEY: I gotta go check something over here.
CHANDLER: What a baby.
ROSS: Total wuss!
MONICA: Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
JOEY: Wow! This looks great!
MONICA: Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap.  Umm, this one is made of bologna.
JOEY: And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
MONICA: You kissed another woman!
CHANDLER: Call it even?!
MONICA: Okay!
ROSS: Well, I’m gonna go get these  in some water.
PHOEBE: Wait you stole those from these people’s wedding?
ROSS: No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby.
ROSS: Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming.
ROSS: Hey!
ROSS: My sweater!
ROSS: I’ve been looking for this for like a month!
PHOEBE: Oh my God!!
JOEY: Oh my God!
KATE: Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?
JOEY: Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be!
JOEY: Huh?
JOEY: Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out!
JOEY: I talk to you and nothin’.
JOEY: You look at me, and it’s nothin’.
JOEY: Nothing.
THE DIRECTOR: Tasty! I’m really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it’s-it’s nice.
KATE: I have a question about this scene.
THE DIRECTOR: Yes?
KATE: Well, I don’t understand why Adrienne’s attracted to Victor.
THE DIRECTOR: Peel the onion. First of all, he’s good looking.
JOEY: Yeah.
KATE: I think my character’s gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
JOEY: Oh, hey, how about this one.
JOEY: Ah, it’s says so in the script!
JOEY: Y'know ah, I-I don’t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you’re a bitch.
KATE: It doesn’t say that in the script.
JOEY: It does in mine!
PHOEBE: I can’t
JOEY: Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
CHANDLER: Y’know who has a great video camera?
PHOEBE: Greg and Jenny?
MONICA: Do you still wanna call ‘em? I wanna call ‘em.
CHANDLER: Let’s call ‘em.
JOEY: Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
MONICA: Hello?  Eighth street deli?
JOEY: Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin’ to that place.
MONICA: Uh sorry, wrong number.
CHANDLER: Here you go.
MONICA: Hello?   It’s the deli again!
JOEY: All right! I’ll have a sandwich!
MONICA: I don’t think this number’s right!
RACHEL: Oh come on!!
MR. TRIBBIANI: Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
JOEY: Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me?  Did you know this isn't Ma?
MR. TRIBBIANI: Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
JOEY: Sure. So how long you been...
MR. TRIBBIANI: Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
JOEY: Since then?!
MR. TRIBBIANI: No, it's only been six years.
MR. TRIBBIANI: I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy.
MR. TRIBBIANI: ...Joe.
MR. TRIBBIANI: Y'ever been in love?
JOEY: ...I d'know.
MR. TRIBBIANI: Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
JOEY: You're one to talk.
MR. TRIBBIANI: Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
JOEY: Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
MR. TRIBBIANI: Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
CHANDLER: Everything’s gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
GURU SAJ: Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!!  That’s supposed to be a duck right? ‘Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
MONICA: Hey, Rach, how was work?
RACHEL: Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair.
MONICA: By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
RACHEL: Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming.
RACHEL: I’m just gonna throw it out, it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
MONICA: Something wrong?
RACHEL: No. Nothing.
CHARLIE: And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.
ROSS: Yeah, that's it?
CHARLIE: Yeah.
JOEY: Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
CHANDLER: No, no, you’re right, it is a ridiculous name!
JOEY: It’s not that bad.
CHANDLER: Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
JOEY: So, you’re just Bing?
MONICA: Because we won our apartment back!
JOEY: What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
MONICA: No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
PHOEBE: I don’t know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it!  Ah-ha!
RACHEL: All right, cut, let’s pick again, pick again.
JOEY: Okay.
RACHEL: Come on apartment! Come on apartment!  Oh! I know queen is high!
JOEY: Uh-huh, not as high as… It worked! King!
CHANDLER: Yeah baby!
MONICA: But, we pick again! We pick again!
JOEY: Why?!
MONICA: I don’t know!
CHANDLER: Tickets please!  That’s courtside baby!
JOEY: Seriously, good game though. Good game.   What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!
CHANDLER: No they didn’t!
CHANDLER: You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
JOEY: It's gonna be worth it.
JOEY: It's a known fact that women love babies, all right?
JOEY: Women love guys who love babies.
JOEY: It's that whole sensitive thing.
JOEY: Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there.
JOEY: Maybe one of them will break away.
JOEY: No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left.
JOEY: All right, gimme the baby.
CHANDLER: No, I got him.
CHANDLER: Oh, seriously you want him?
JOEY: Hello.
CHANDLER: Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
JOEY: You wanna smell him?
JOEY: Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
JOEY: What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
CHANDLER: Well, we are great guys.
RACHEL: Bye.
ROSS: Well, not really.
ROSS: I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon.
ROSS: Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
MONICA: Well Ross, you be careful now. You don’t want to get a reputation as y’know Professor McNailshisstudents.
ROSS: Yeah. What-what should I do?
JOEY: Well Ross, it seems pretty clear.
JOEY: I mean what’s more important?
JOEY: What people think or how you feel, huh?
JOEY: Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
MONICA: Joey that is so sweet.
CHANDLER: Hey.
JOEY: Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
CHANDLER: I couldn’t do it.
JOEY: You couldn’t do it?!
CHANDLER: Hey, relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight.
MONICA: What?! You’re going out with her again!
ROSS: Going out with who?
CHANDLER: Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
ROSS: Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh
CHANDLER: No, that was Dana Caplin.
MONICA: Joey! You didn’t even know her!
JOEY: Ah whatever!
JOEY: Morning! Hey, how’s my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
WAYNE: Don’t touch him!
JOEY: Okay!
JOEY: All right.
JOEY: Umm, all right Wayne, level with me.
JOEY: I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired.
JOEY: Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part!
JOEY: Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance!
JOEY: I mean, I love-I love this little guy!
JOEY: Ah-ah!!
JOEY: Okay, that’s why you didn’t want me to touch him right?
JOEY: Here you go!
JOEY: Okay?
JOEY: Stupid!
JOEY: I can’t believe it!
JOEY: God!
JOEY: Hey, how you doin’?
ROSS: Hey.
RACHEL: Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
ROSS: No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
RACHEL: I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
ROSS: For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
RACHEL: You had no
ROSS: Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
RACHEL: But I told you, I didn’t have the time!
ROSS: Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
RACHEL: Wh, Ross what do you want from me?
RACHEL: You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
MONICA: I know.
PHOEBE: Ooh, I have to tell you something.
MONICA: What?
PHOEBE: But I can’t tell you.
MONICA: Okay, but wouldn’t it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
PHOEBE: Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn’t tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
MONICA: Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
PHOEBE: No.
MONICA: Does it have to do with Joey?
PHOEBE: No.
MONICA: Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
PHOEBE: No, but let’s come back to that later!
RICHARD: Hi!
MONICA: Richard!
RICHARD: Actually, I’m not here to complement the chef.
MONICA: Ohh… Oh, that’s okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef.
MONICA: Like I have nothing better to do!
MONICA: So what’s up?
RICHARD: Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
MONICA: Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
RICHARD: No! I came here to tell you something else.  I came here  to tell you I still love you.
JOEY: One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
RACHEL: So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
JOEY: Maybe!  Well! Well…so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!
DINA: Joey, I am scared to death about this.
DINA: But I really think I can do it, I’m just gonna need some help.
DINA: And Bobby’s gonna be here the whole time.
BOBBY: You bet I am!  And to answer your earlier question, we’re straight-up gangster rap.
DINA: Look, Rachel’s told me how much easier you’ve made all this on her. Why can’t you do that for me?
JOEY: Because! ‘Cause… ‘Cause you’re my baby sister!
DINA: And you’re my big brother!
DINA: I mean, you’re my favorite guy in the whole world.
DINA: I’m not even scared to tell mom and dad.
DINA: I was scared of telling you.
JOEY: Well I’d be scared of them, but all right.
DINA: Joey, I can’t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.
DINA: I want him to have his uncle.
DINA: Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
JOEY: Of course he’s gonna have his Uncle Joey!
DINA: We’re gonna be all right. I mean, even if we’re not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.
JOEY: That’s right! By his uncle too!
BOBBY: And by you.
RACHEL: Okay Bobby, why don’t we just come over here and let them have a little moment.
JOEY: Come here!
RACHEL: No! Seriously! What’s wrong with you?!
DANNY: I had a really nice time tonight.
RACHEL: So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
DANNY: I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
RACHEL: You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch?  Ohhh! I saw
DANNY: Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
RACHEL: Hi!
KRISTA: Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!
DANNY: Like it would help.
KRISTA: You are so bad!
DANNY: You are!
KRISTA: You are!
DANNY: You are!
KRISTA: You are!
DANNY: You are!
KRISTA: You are!
DANNY: You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.
RACHEL: Uh, it was very nice meeting you.
CHANDLER: Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
JILL: Hi Mom, it's Jill.
CHANDLER: She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!
JILL: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
CHANDLER: Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.

CHANDLER: I’m not-I’m not-I’m not gay!
PHOEBE: Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
RACHEL: Uh-huh.
PHOEBE: That sounds great!
JOEY: Hey!
MONICA: Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can’t eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
JOEY: There’s gravy?
MONICA: If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time.
MONICA: That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that’s your department now.
MONICA: What are you doing?
JOEY: I think I left a donut up here.

CHANDLER: Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
DOUG: Now get on out of here, you!
CHANDLER: Hey Bob.
BOB: Hey! How’s my pal Toby doing today?
CHANDLER: If I see him, I’ll ask.
BOB: Toby!
CHANDLER: Yeah!
MR. FRANKLIN: Oh then you know each other.
CHANDLER: We’re on a semi-first name basis.
MR. FRANKLIN: What do you think of adding him to our team?
CHANDLER: Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don’t know if he has what it takes.
MR. FRANKLIN: Really? They love him down on six.
CHANDLER: But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here.
ROSS: Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
CHANDLER: A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
ROSS: No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman’s tux!
CHANDLER: What?
ROSS: That’s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film…that Batman film he was in.
CHANDLER: You can’t wear that! I’m wearing the famous tux! James Bond’s tux!
ROSS: So?
CHANDLER: So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.
CHANDLER: Sorry, I just don’t like the idea of when I say "I do," he’s thinking, "Yeah, I’d do her too!"
MONICA: Well then we still have a problem.
CHANDLER: Yeah!
PHOEBE: With what?
MONICA: Well, we’re trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they’re all either boring or annoying or y’know, can’t stop staring at the ladies.
PHOEBE: Oo! You should have one of us do it!
MONICA: Phoebe, we’re getting
PHOEBE: No! No! It’s-it’s uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
JOEY: I call it!!
PHOEBE: What?! No! It was my idea!
CHANDLER: Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
JOEY: Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
CHANDLER: We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
ROSS: See, I see.... big passion in your future.
RACHEL: Really?
ROSS: I do.
RACHEL: Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]
PHOEBE: That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why.
PHOEBE: Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn’t sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
MONICA: Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
PHOEBE: Yeah, I would’ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
MONICA: What?!?!
PHOEBE: Okay, this is what I’m talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
MONICA: You can spill. In the sink.
PHOEBE: Aw, honey it’s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don’t see that happening.
MONICA: I love you, too.
PHOEBE: Aww, good.  What?
MONICA: What? I’m just said.
PHOEBE: No you’re not, you’re wondering which cushion it is.
RACHEL: Oh my God! Are you serious?!
ROSS: Uh-huh.
RACHEL: I would love to live with you Ross.. that’s-that’s great! Thank you!
ROSS: Well, I’m-I’m just glad I could, y’know, help you out.
RACHEL: Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me!
RACHEL: I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless.
RACHEL: You just saved me!
RACHEL: You’re my hero!
ROSS: Hero, I uh, I don’t know—well, all right.
RACHEL: Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
ROSS: Oh please!   You’re gonna say things now, aren’t ya?
PHOEBE: No.
PHOEBE: No, I won’t.
PHOEBE: But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise.
PHOEBE: She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up!
DIRECTOR: ...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready?
JOEY: Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
DIRECTOR: Lose the robe.
JOEY: Me?
CHANDLER: That's great.
CHANDLER: Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
JANICE: No, no, I'm still working on mine.
CHANDLER: That's it?
PHOEBE: Yeah, it was really hard.
CHANDLER: Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
PHOEBE: Ok, you weren't there.
TONY: Wow! That’s ah, that’s pretty nice!
JOEY: Pretty nice?
CHANDLER: You’ll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
TONY: We don’t have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We’ve got a canoe.
CHANDLER: Y'know, I, I really don’t think we need a canoe.
TONY: You gotta take the canoe!
CHANDLER: All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
PETER: We’re not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
JOEY: Good for you!!
RACHEL: Pheebs?
PHOEBE: Yeah?
CHANDLER: Okay. Then I guess it’s just, wait here then.   Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
TICKET COUNTER ATTENDANT: One ticket to Yemen?
CHANDLER: Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
TICKET COUNTER ATTENDANT: I’m sorry sir, I don’t understand.
CHANDLER: What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
TICKET COUNTER ATTENDANT: Are you travelling with a child?
CHANDLER: No.
CHANDLER: All right, y’know what, she’s  gonna think that I’m handing you a credit card, but what I’m really gonna do is hand you a library card.
CHANDLER: Okay, but this is the last time.
CHANDLER: With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there.
CHANDLER: Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
JOEY: Hey.
CHANDLER: Hey.
JOEY: How’s she doing?
CHANDLER: She?
JOEY: Well yeah, don’t-don’t you think it’s a she?
CHANDLER: I don’t know.  I can’t tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
JOEY: Well, anyway, I got to go change, I’m ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
CHANDLER: Excuse me?
JOEY: What?
JOEY: Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
PHOEBE: Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
CHANDLER: Well sensitive is important, pick him.
PHOEBE: Yeah.
JOEY: Oh sure, go with the sissy.
PHOEBE: Jason is not a sissy!
JOEY: Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
ROSS: Hi.
RACHEL: So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
ROSS: Yeah.
ROSS: Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn’t matter.
ROSS: I mean, I think it would’ve happened either way.
ROSS: I mean if you hadn’t initiated it I-I-I know I would’ve.
RACHEL: It was an amazing night.
ROSS: It was. It was an amazing night.
RACHEL: You think it looked amazing?
DR. LONG: Do we have a name yet?
RACHEL: No, not yet.
DR. LONG: That’s fine, for now we’ll just call her Baby Girl Green.
RACHEL: Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
RACHEL: Hello baby girl.
ROSS: Ah-ha, nowhere to run!
RACHEL: I don’t like sitting up here! I’m just gonna over
PHOEBE: No Rachel! They got here first!
PHOEBE: Why is Ross doing that?
ROSS: DANGER
RACHEL: Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
JOEY: No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.
RACHEL: Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!
JOEY: Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!
RACHEL: Really?
JOEY: Yeah! Look!
RACHEL: I’ve never lived like this before.
JOEY: I know.
JOEY: All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food.
RACHEL: Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
JOEY: I don't know, but one of the extras sure did!  Hey, listen    Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
RACHEL: Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support    you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so
JOEY: Also so
RACHEL: Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!
JOEY: Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely    gay stuff!
JOEY: OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
MONICA: About what?
JOEY: He's planning your birthday party.
MONICA: Oh my God! I love him!
JOEY: You'd better act surprised.
PHOEBE: About what?
MONICA: My surprise party!
PHOEBE: What surprise party?
MONICA: Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
PHOEBE: Well, he didn't tell me.
JOEY: Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
PHOEBE: This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
MONICA: No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
PHOEBE: Yuh-huh!
PHOEBE: I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.
PHOEBE: I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.
PHOEBE: Looks like I was second to last.
MONICA: Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad.
CHANDLER: Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that’s because I didn’t send him an invitation.
MONICA: Chandler! He’s your father.  he should be at the wedding.
CHANDLER: I don’t even know the man. Okay? We’re not that close. I haven’t seen him in years.
MONICA: Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!
CHANDLER: It’s not like we run in the same circles.
CHANDLER: I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
PHOEBE: Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
CHANDLER: Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
MONICA: So what! As long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil I don’t care.
PHOEBE: Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
CHARLTON HESTON: Hello! Who’s in there?
JOEY: How ya doin’?
CHARLTON HESTON: Who in the hell are you?
JOEY: I guess you wouldn’t believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
MONICA: No-no, Rachel, don’t get it! He can’t see us!
PHOEBE: No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
RACHEL: I’m not gonna marry Chandler!
PHOEBE: Not after this!
RACHEL: Okay, you guys, just relax.  I doooo.
JOSHUA: I gotta go.
RACHEL: Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua!   Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
RACHEL: Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
PHOEBE: Okay.
RACHEL: So Pheebs, what is the book about?
PHOEBE: I thought you said you read it in high school.
RACHEL: Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway—umm, what is this book about?
RACHEL: Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?
RACHEL: Y'know what, actually…  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
NANCY: I thought you didn't smoke.
RACHEL: Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know?
RACHEL: Y'know what I mean, like dubbies?
RACHEL: And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!"
RACHEL: But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
KIM: We get high.
RACHEL: Oh, me too.
KIM: I'm kidding.
RACHEL: Oh, me too.
RACHEL: Oh, are you sure you're ok?
ROSS: Yeah.
RACHEL: Does it still hurt?
ROSS: Yeah.
PHOEBE: What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
MONICA: Hi.
PHOEBE: Hey, how'd it go?
JOEY: Excellent.
MONICA: We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
ROSS: What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
PHOEBE: You know what? You are right. I
RACHEL: Good for you Pheebs!
PHOEBE: Ok.
PHOEBE: Okay  If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean
JOEY: This sucks! I didn’t know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I’m so tired!
CHANDLER: It’s 6:00.
RACHEL: Hi!
JOEY: Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well.
RACHEL: Handling it?
RACHEL: What do you mean, handling it?
RACHEL: There’s nothing to handle.
RACHEL: Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn’t for me and Joshua.
RACHEL: Y’know, they’re not gonna get married anyway!
CHANDLER: What?
RACHEL: Come on!
RACHEL: They rushed into this thing so fast it’s ridiculous!
RACHEL: And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they’ve done and they’re call the whole thing off.
RACHEL: I’m telling ya, you’re gonna be dancing at my wedding before you’re dancing at there’s.
PHOEBE: What the hell is this?!
PHOEBE: What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can’t use for another two months?!
PHOEBE: This sucks!
PHOEBE: All right, what’s my next present?
CHANDLER: All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
MONICA: Enhh
CHANDLER: I’ve got canned goods.
JOEY: Hey, you guys! Take a look at this!  Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
CHANDLER: Excellent hole, Joe.
JOEY: Oh no! No!! My hole!!
MONICA: Ow!! Ow!!!
JOEY: What?! What?!! What is it?!
RACHEL: My drinking?
JOANNA: Oh, I must’ve said that after you left.
RACHEL: Said what? Exactly.
JOANNA: That you enjoyed the occasional drink…ing binge.
RACHEL: Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I’m leaving! You are just a horrible person!
JOANNA: Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!!
JOANNA: If you’re gonna get all sensitive about it!
JOANNA: I don’t want to lose you.
JOANNA: What if I, create a position for you?
JOANNA: I’ll make you an assistant buyer in this department.
RACHEL: Say more things like that.
JOANNA: You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
RACHEL: I’d need an expense account.
JOANNA: Done!
RACHEL: And an assistant.
JOANNA: Sophie, get in here!
RACHEL: Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
JOEY: Oh my!
RACHEL: They're male nurses.
JOEY: Not in my head.
RACHEL: Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
MONICA: Umm.  Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
RACHEL: What?
RACHEL: What are you talking about?!
RACHEL: You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.
RACHEL: I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me.
RACHEL: Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
MONICA: Umm, why don't you give
RACHEL: What?
MONICA: Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
RACHEL: Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some
JOEY: Yep! There's always room for
RACHEL: Joey, how do you make
JOEY: Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh,  Grandma's chicken salad
MONICA: Hello, this is Monica...
MONICA: Yeah???
MONICA: Oh...
MONICA: Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down.
MONICA: Thank you.
MONICA: Okay. Let’s bring it in.
RACHEL: Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
ROSS: Here you go.
RACHEL: That almost hit me in the face.
CHANDLER: Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
CHANDLER: Hey!
MONICA: Hey!
CHANDLER: Y’know I’m-I’m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
MONICA: Oh boy, me too!
CHANDLER: Y’know I was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
MONICA: Yeah?
CHANDLER: Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
MONICA: The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
CHANDLER: That’s me! Come on!
MONICA: Okay.  But wait, we can’t. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we’re supposed to have lunch.
CHANDLER: Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
MONICA: Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
CASSIE: I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
CHANDLER: Hi! Nice to meet you!
CASSIE: Nice to meet you too.
MONICA: So, are you ready to go?
CASSIE: Yeah.
MONICA: Chandler!
CHANDLER: I’ll be right with you.
ROSS: Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple.
ROSS: Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple.
ROSS: You can take it off.
ROSS: Just slice that baby right off!
DR. RHODES: Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.  What are you doing?
ROSS: Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
DR. RHODES: Well that's not a third nipple.
ROSS: No?
DR. RHODES: First of all, it's on your ass.
ROSS: Well then, what is it?!
DR. RHODES: Wait a minute, hold it.  Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
DR. JOHNSON: I'm with Hamilton!
DR. RHODES: He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
KRISTEN: Umm, this is great wine.
ROSS: It’s from France…In Europe…Western Europe. Y’know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
KRISTEN: Really?
ROSS: Uh-hmm—Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.
KRISTEN: I studied for a year in Barcelona.
ROSS: Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking
KRISTEN: I love hiking!
ROSS: Oh that’s great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo
JANICE: So? Congratulations you two, I didn’t even know you got married.
RACHEL: Oh we-we didn’t.
ROSS: No-no. We
JANICE: What?!
ROSS: Um uh…We’re-we’re just having this baby together but uh, uh that’s all.
JANICE: Why?!!
ROSS: Uh well umm…we’re just not in that place, y’know? But we’re very excited about this.
JANICE: Oh. Well then shut me up.
RACHEL: Just tell me how.
JANICE: Uh-oh, I feel another one coming.
JOEY: Let it go, Ross.
ROSS: Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
MONICA: Do you all promise?
MONICA: Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
JOEY: You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
ROSS: Hey, Pheebs.
PHOEBE: Dear Ms. Buffay.
PHOEBE: Thank you for calling attention to our error.
PHOEBE: We have credited your account with five hundred dollars.
PHOEBE: We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this-  -
CHANDLER: Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the
MONICA: Honey, both yours.
RACHEL: Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
MONICA: Yeah? The work problem?
RACHEL: Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
CHANDLER: What problem did you tell him you had?
RACHEL: Oh that’s not important. The point is, I really—I think everything’s gonna be okay.
MONICA: Okay, I’ve got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
CHANDLER: No thanks, Mom!
PHOEBE: Ha-ha, it’s not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
MONICA: Very good,  so good.
PHOEBE: I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
RACHEL: Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn’t call.
RACHEL: I mean you’d think he’d be worried about me not showing up at his club.
RACHEL: Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
PHOEBE: Come on! Look where you are!!
MONICA: When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
PHOEBE: Remember, a virgin for me please.
MONICA: Oh! And don’t let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
CHANDLER: Ahh, come on! Y’know what—y’know what, I think I’m just gonna go home and call Kathy.
PHOEBE: Well, if you think it will help.
CHANDLER: No!
CHANDLER: That was a test!
CHANDLER: In a couple of hours I’m gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me!
CHANDLER: And then after that, I’m gonna get so drunk, I’m gonna wanna call Janice
PHOEBE: You should! How is she?
CHANDLER: Ohhh!!
MONICA: I think somebody needs another lap dance.
MONICA: All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
PHOEBE: You do?
MONICA: You don’t?  Well, that’s the difference between a professional and a layman.
PHOEBE: That and arrogance.
JOEY: Hey.
MONICA: Hey! How was sailing?
JOEY: Wow thanks!
CHANDLER: Joe?
JOEY: Yeah!
CHANDLER: Uh, you’ve had a lot of sex right?
JOEY: When? Today? Some, not a lot.
CHANDLER: Well, it’s just the reason that I’m asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to—I mean I really wanted to, but I couldn’t….
CHANDLER: There huh—hmm, there-there was an incident.
JOEY: Don’t worry about that man, that happens.
CHANDLER: It’s happened to you?
JOEY: Yeah! Once.
CHANDLER: Well, what’d you do?
JOEY: I did it anyway.
JOEY: ‘Sup? ‘Sup dude?
CHANDLER: Take whatever you want, just please don’t hurt me.
JOEY: So you’re playing a little
CHANDLER: Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
JOEY: Come on man, really how old?!
CHANDLER: Young! You’re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody’s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
ROSS: And they knew about it?
PHOEBE: Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
ROSS: Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
PHOEBE: Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don’t know what the big deal is!
ROSS: The big deal is I don’t want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle—beer! Cold beer.
ROSS: Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
MONICA: Do you always have to bring him here?
ROSS: I didn't wanna leave him alone.
ROSS: Alright?
ROSS: We- we had our first fight this morning.
ROSS: I think it has to do with my working late.
ROSS: I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
CHANDLER: Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
ROSS: Oh, that'd be great!
ROSS: Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
CHANDLER: Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
CHANDLER: Check this out.
CHANDLER: It says here that there’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums!
CHANDLER: "It’s almost as good as being there."
JOEY: It’s better! You can’t go to a museum in your underwear!
JOEY: Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
JESTER: Uh, may I help you?
MONICA: Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I’m the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
JESTER: Look, it’s like I told you, there’s nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
JOEY: All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
JESTER: Nobody sees the king!
JOEY: Oh-ho-kay, I’m talking to the king.
JESTER: Hey! You can’t go back there!
JANICE: Oh my God.
ROSS: So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh?
ROSS: I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don’t have to sell those cookies anymore.
SARAH: Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a
ROSS: Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
SARAH: Yeah.
SARAH: My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he’d be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
ROSS: I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
SARAH: No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he’s gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
MONICA: Oh, um, I don’t know if that’s a good idea.
RICHARD: Oh. Look, just friends, I won’t grope you. I promise.
MONICA: No, I just I think that it’s too soon.
RICHARD: No it’s not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
CHANDLER: I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
ROSS: And now you want that money back.
CHANDLER: Exactly.
ROSS: Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
CHANDLER: It’s not a real game! I made it up!
ROSS: I’m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
JOEY: I don't know.
JOEY: But I can see through your sheet.
JOEY: Yeah, yeah, that's her.
JOEY: But y'know what?
JOEY: Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
MONICA: Why?
JOEY: Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
MONICA: What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
JOEY: No. No. No. She lives on the
MONICA: No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby.
MONICA: And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway.
MONICA: You've been counting wrong.
JOEY: I did
RACHEL: Monica, betting the apartment, I don’t know about this.
MONICA: Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
RACHEL: Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
MONICA: No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.
RACHEL: All right, let’s do it.
ROSS: All right, gentlemen, you’re up first.
JOEY: Okay.
CHANDLER: Okay.
ROSS: You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins—stop it —now. What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
JOEY: Big fat goalie.
ROSS: Correct. Rachel claims
CHANDLER: Dangerous Liaisons
ROSS: Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
JOEY: Weekend at Bernie’s
PHOEBE: Well, look, why don’t you just, why don’t you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
MONICA: Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
CHANDLER: No you can’t.
CHANDLER: You don’t want to be guys, you’d be all hairy and wouldn’t live as long.
PHOEBE: Y’know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
CHANDLER: Okay.
PHOEBE: I’m sorry.
MONICA: And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I’ve only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio.
MONICA: You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
RACHEL: Well, that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
MONICA: Pete, can I get you something else?
PETE: Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you’re given’ ‘em out.
MONICA: Haven’t you and I covered that topic?
PETE: Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you….
MONICA: Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
PETE: Well, if that were true, I’d dating my Aunt Ruth.
PETE: And the two times we went out were just plain awkward.
PETE: Come on, you think she should go out with me, don’t you?
RACHEL: Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?
RACHEL: I mean that ain’t a pretty picture in the morning, y’know what I mean.
RACHEL: That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
MONICA: I mean really, think about it.
PETE: Ho-ho, I will.
CHANDLER: I believe I read that somewhere!
ROSS: That only is not funny, it's physically impossible!
ROSS: Okay?
ROSS: Depending    on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...
ROSS: It's not funny!
CHANDLER: I respectfully disagree.
ROSS: I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
CHANDLER: Who cares? Nobody reads those things
ROSS: You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today.
CHANDLER: I don't have a page.
ROSS: Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
ROSS: I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
CHANDLER: Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
ROSS: No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
CHANDLER: So, rocks.
ROSS: I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
JOEY: Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little?
ROSS: I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
JOEY: Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
ROSS: Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice
JOEY: You
ROSS: Why?
JOEY: Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop.  Get up! Get up! Get up!
EMILY: I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don’t think your son will think it’s yours and be horribly traumatised?
ROSS: Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
EMILY: Ohh, it’s time to go.
ROSS: Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock’s a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes.
ROSS: Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes?
ROSS: Twice?
EMILY: Well that’s ambitious.
ROSS: Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
EMILY: That’s Carol with your son!

RACHEL: Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
MONICA: Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
RACHEL: Monica, you don’t even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
MONICA: Y’know what? I am
RACHEL: I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
MONICA: Okay.

CHANDLER: Transit Authority?
CHANDLER: Yes, hello.
CHANDLER: I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus.
JOEY: Hi, here's the deal.
JOEY: We lost a carseat on a bus today.
JOEY: It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller.
JOEY: Oh, and there was a baby in it.

ROSS: I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment.
ROSS: And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but—I'm sorry.
ROSS: I, I can't help but notice you're naked and  I applaud you.
ROSS: Man, I wish I was naked.
ROSS: I mean, this-this looks so great.
ROSS: That is how God intended it.
RACHEL: Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship!
RACHEL: But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him!
RACHEL: Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest!
RACHEL: Okay, you go!
MONICA: My turn? What-what are you talking about?
RACHEL: Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.

RACHEL: And he said, "Laundry?
RACHEL: Is
MONICA: Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
RACHEL: Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
MONICA: Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big……ot.
RACHEL: What?!
MONICA: Mr. Bigot. He tells the most
RACHEL: All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
MONICA: Me and Chandler?!
PHOEBE: I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
A FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
PHOEBE: I don't know! I didn't come with her!
MONICA: All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
ALL: A test?!!
MONICA: Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah!  We should have essay questions!!
PHOEBE: Okay I’ve got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?
CLIFF: I’d have to say…the talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that you’re making me eat him.
PHOEBE: Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? I’m sorry.
MR. FRANKLIN: Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.
CHANDLER: I think it’s best sir.
MR. FRANKLIN: But we really do need to find someone up here.
MR. FRANKLIN: The work is starting to pile up.
MR. FRANKLIN: I’ve got a stack of documents on my desk this high.
CHANDLER: Y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder and claim you never got ‘em.
MR. FRANKLIN: That’s a good one.
CHANDLER: What does a guy have to
ROSS: Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
ALL: Hi, Julie!
PHOEBE: Isn’t there a national football league.
CHANDLER: Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
RACHEL: Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
PHOEBE: Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
JOEY: When they’re hungry enough, they’ll come in.
TAG: Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
JOEY: I don’t know. You uh, you got something for me?
TAG: Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.

MONICA: That's
CHANDLER: Hey, I've been honing!
ROSS: What was with the dishes?
CHANDLER: Oh, uh..
CHANDLER: I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know?
CHANDLER: I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
MONICA: Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
PHOEBE: Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!
MONICA: Great, now he's waving back.
JOEY: Man, we gotta do something about that guy.
JOEY: This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment.
JOEY: It creeps me out!
JOEY: I feel like I can't do stuff!
MONICA: What kinda stuff?
JOEY: Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
PHOEBE: You cook naked?
JOEY: Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
CHANDLER: What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
MONICA: Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
PHOEBE: It’s just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn’t called. Not that I even care, y'know.
MONICA: Phoebe why don’t you just call her? You obviously want to.
PHOEBE: You think you know me so well.
MONICA: Well, don’t ‘cha wanna?
PHOEBE: Yeah.
MONICA: Okay, well I do know you.
PHOEBE: That’s what I said.
MONICA: Well so?
PHOEBE: I can’t.
PHOEBE: I can’t.
PHOEBE: She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was ‘Okay, bye Pheebs’ gone.
PHOEBE: Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I’ve ever had in like all my lives.
ROSS: Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
CHANDLER: Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
ROSS: It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
CHANDLER: It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
ROSS: Nuh-uh.
CHANDLER: Yuh-huh.
ROSS: So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
CHANDLER: Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear.
CHANDLER: This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?
ROSS: No.
CHANDLER: Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
ROSS: Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my
CHANDLER: Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
JOEY: That's the rule.
CHANDLER: What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
JOEY: How'd you get to that?
CHANDLER: Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
JOEY: You knew about that?
CHANDLER: Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
JOEY: Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
CHANDLER: What do you mean, like, buy it together?
JOEY: Yeah
CHANDLER: You think we're ready for something like that?
JOEY: Why not?
CHANDLER: Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
JOEY: Why, are you moving out?
CHANDLER: I'm not moving out.
JOEY: You'd tell me if you were moving out right
CHANDLER: Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
JOEY: Aw, I know all about Kip!
CHANDLER: It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
JOEY: Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
CHANDLER: Aw, don't do that
PHOEBE: Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
ERIC: Oh no, stay here we’ll keep doing this. I’ll pay you.
PHOEBE: No, I got in trouble for that before. I’ll see you later.
ERIC: Absolutely.  I love the way you kiss.
MONA: Oh my God! Oh my God! I’m so sorry!
ROSS: Aw forget it, it’s from
DR. GREEN: You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! I’m gonna kill you!!
ROSS: Y’know this is actually not a great time for me.
RACHEL: Okay! So, we’ll just stay married.
ROSS: Yes, exactly!
RACHEL: And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
ROSS: Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I’d have to talk you into this more.
RACHEL: What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?!
ROSS: Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you?
ROSS: Really?
ROSS: I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.!
ROSS: It’s
RACHEL: Ohh, okay, I’m sorry.
RACHEL: You’re right.
RACHEL: Y’know what?
ROSS: I’m asking you to do me a favor.
RACHEL: You are asking me to be your wife!
ROSS: And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
MONICA: Oh my God!
PAUL: I know, I know, I'm such an idiot.
MONICA: My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
PAUL: Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
MONICA: -leg?
PAUL: That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
MONICA: You actually broke her watch?
RACHEL: Barry, I'm sorry...
RACHEL: I am so sorry...
RACHEL: I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...
ROSS: No real-, honey, really it’s fine, just g-go with Susan.
ROSS: Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea.
ROSS: Okay, okay, bye
PHOEBE: So what are they doing?
ROSS: I don’t know, something girlie.
PHOEBE: Hey, you’re early.
MONICA: What are you doing with the lamp?
PHOEBE: I’m just taking it to be re-wired.
MONICA: Oh, well don’t take it to the same place you took the stereo, ‘cause they’ve had that thing for over a week.
PHOEBE: No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
MR. HECKLES: You’re disturbing my oboe practice.
PHOEBE: You don’t play the oboe!
MR. HECKLES: I could play the oboe!
RACHEL: Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
MARK: Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
ROSS: All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
MARK: What is going on?
ROSS: What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!
RACHEL: Ross!
ROSS: I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie!
ROSS: What do I have to do to get some service?!
ROSS: Hi Rach.
MONA: Ross?
ROSS: Yeah?
MONA: Hey it’s Mona! From the wedding.
ROSS: Oh hi!
MONA: Hi!
ROSS: Wow! Uh…how are you?
MONA: I’m good except umm, you still owe me a dance.
ROSS: Oh that’s right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?
MONA: Oh you’re serious. Sure!
ROSS: Great! Well umm
MONA: I think I might need one more cup of coffee.
ROSS: Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.
MONA: Okay.
PHOEBE: Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him.
PHOEBE: Go!
RACHEL: What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
PHOEBE: I may play the fool at times, but I’m a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won’t quit.
PHOEBE: I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
RACHEL: Oh God… Oh, he’s in there right now?
PHOEBE: Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
RACHEL: Uh, let’s rip!
PHOEBE: Really? Are you sure?
RACHEL: Oh Phoebe!
PHOEBE: Okay, sorry. Yeah.

ROSS: I'm gonna be out today.
ROSS: Can you    just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
CHANDLER: You don't trust him?
ROSS: I think the check in is that way.
RACHEL: Ahh.
JOEY: Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
MONICA: Well there’s some people who do want to marry me.
JOEY: There are?
MONICA: Yeah! Richard!
JOEY: R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and Chandler’s tellin’ ya how much he hates marriage?!
MONICA: That’s right.
JOEY: Chandler

MONICA: That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife!
MONICA: That-that he’s against marriage and always will be!
JOEY: You got
ROSS: You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
RACHEL: I knew.
ROSS: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
RACHEL: I did.
ROSS: Oh.
ROSS: Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here—but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?
ROSS: Sometime?
ROSS: Maybe?
RACHEL: Yeah, maybe...
ROSS: Okay... okay, maybe I will...
CHANDLER: Well, I just thought it’d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
JOEY: Well, you’re amazing.
CHANDLER: Oh no-no-no.
JOEY: A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That’s the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
CHANDLER: Well, y’know I’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
JOEY: Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
CHANDLER: Oh, I don’t know.
JOEY: Oh-no-no-no, you are!
JOEY: You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I’m gonna do that.
CHANDLER: You mean with Casey.
JOEY: No-no-no, I think I’m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She’s pretty cool.
CHANDLER: Or Casey.
JOEY: No-no, Kathy.
CHANDLER: Could be Casey.
JOEY: No. No, Kathy.
CHANDLER: Consider Casey.
JOEY: I think somebody’s got a little crush on Casey.
JOEY: How ‘bout I fix you two up?
JOEY: What do you think?
CHANDLER: That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
CHANDLER: Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
MONICA: Honey, what’s the matter?
CHANDLER: I just saw Janice.
SINGER: ‘Cause every time I see your face, I can’t help but fall from grace. I know.....
JOEY: Wow! This girl is good.
PHOEBE: Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
CHANDLER: I like her.
PHOEBE: Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
CHANDLER: Well, that’s pretty much all I’m looking for from these people.
MONICA: Look at you. All jealous.
ROSS: Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she’s more.. y'know, and you’re more
JOEY: Say you'll stay beside me
PHOEBE: Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she’s done.
SINGER: Okay, my next song’s called: Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say.
SINGER: I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldn’t Have Left You That Way.
PHOEBE: Oh no, one of those ‘look for the hidden meaning’ songs.
ROSS: Yes, hello.
ROSS: I have a question.
ROSS: Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face.
ROSS: A beard and a moustache.
ROSS: Thank you.
ROSS: No,
RACHEL: What?! What else did he say?
ROSS: Umm, he said he thought I was funny.
ROSS: So… Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
RACHEL: Ross, no! There is
ROSS: Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
RACHEL: Ross, I am a human doodle!!
ROSS: Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun!
ROSS: And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna
ROSS: Okay, there was
ROSS: Come on!
RACHEL: Oh wait, don’t you have to pay for your,  Busty Ladies?
ROSS: No, it’s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don’t
MONICA: Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
JOEY: You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
MONICA: So?!
JOEY: Whoa, ah!! We’re you just gonna give me some lemonade?
MONICA: Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
JOEY: Oh right, right.
MONICA: I don’t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
JOEY: Well usually...yeah!
JOEY: Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.
JOEY: Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me.
JOEY: I’m such a jerk.
MONICA: It’s okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
RACHEL: Hmmm... this is so nice.
ROSS: OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
RACHEL: OK.
ROSS: OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
RACHEL: Ohhh!!!!
ROSS: Yes, yes, that's right...
RACHEL: Oh, look at the little cat!
ROSS: What?  Ow!
DAVID: Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.
CHANDLER: I didn't mean
DAVID: It's brilliant!
DAVID: Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella!
DAVID: well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding...
DAVID: Thank you, Chandler.
DAVID: Sincerely.
CHANDLER: Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
CHANDLER: David, I'm pretending to
PHOEBE: Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.  Come on Joey! You can’t win if you don’t ask any
JOEY: What?!
PHOEBE: Well, you promised me a fun road trip!
PHOEBE: We’ve been on the road six hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half!
PHOEBE: We are switching at the next rest stop and
JOEY: All right. All right.
PHOEBE: Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
JOEY: Really? I don’t
PHOEBE: Sing!!
HITCHHIKER: Morning!
1ST CUSTOMER: Everything was delicious!
MONICA: Thank you!
2ND CUSTOMER: It was. The duck in particular was superb.
MONICA: Thank you!    You haven't said anything...
3RD CUSTOMER: Actually I do have one small complaint.
MONICA: Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
3RD CUSTOMER: The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind    of a mood-killer!
MONICA: What musician?
JOEY: We did?
MONICA: You owe me 20 bucks.
RACHEL: Thank you. Thank you so much!
MONICA: Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
RACHEL: Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner?
RACHEL: What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
CHANDLER: All right, I'm nine years old.
ROSS: Oh, I hate this story.
CHANDLER: We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.
CHANDLER: I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
RACHEL: Oh my god.
CHANDLER: Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
RACHEL: Hey, who's this little naked guy?
ROSS: That little naked guy would be me.
RACHEL: Aww, look at the little thing.
CHANDLER: Who are those people?
ROSS: Got me.
MONICA: Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
RACHEL: Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
MONICA: Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
ROSS: Looks like a fun gang.
JOEY: Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
TAG: So, what’s this about?
PHOEBE: Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.
TAG: No.  This is my red sweater.
PHOEBE: Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or…poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
TAG: What’s going on Rach?
RACHEL: Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y’know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?
TAG: Y’know, I’m actually glad Phoebe called.
TAG: I know we broke up because you thought I wasn’t mature enough, but I’ve really grown up and think we should get back together.
RACHEL: Oh, it’s just not the right time.
TAG: It is the right time.
RACHEL: Okay.

JANICE: It’s you. This is yours.
CHANDLER: What?!
JANICE: Look how nervous he gets! We haven’t slept together in years!
CHANDLER: That’s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?

ROSS: Y’know, y’know I’m lookin’ and I don’t think anyone’s home here.

MONICA: You had no relationship!!
RACHEL: No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
MONICA: Oh God, stop with the plan!
MONICA: So what, so what you saw him with a girl?
MONICA: Who cares?!
MONICA: That doesn't mean anything!
MONICA: Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
RACHEL: She was kinda stupid.
RACHEL: You're right.

CHANDLER: Oh, that's Ross's.
RACHEL: Oh...  Oh my God. He remembered.
PHOEBE: Remembered what?
RACHEL: It was like months ago.
RACHEL: We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl.
RACHEL: Oh!
RACHEL: I can't believe he remembered!
PHOEBE: Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
MONICA: I can't believe he did this.

BONNIE: Thanks! You too.
RACHEL: I believe it.
RACHEL: Yes, I do.
ROSS: No you do—y'know what, you’re not gonna suck me into this.
RACHEL: Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
ROSS: I do not always have to be—okay, okay.
RACHEL: Jurassic Park
MONICA: I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
JOEY: Maybe we should check the trash chute.

JOEY: That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
PHOEBE: Hey!
RACHEL: There he is!
MONICA: Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!
ROSS: Just, y'know out.
RACHEL: Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!

PHOEBE: I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
LESLIE: What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
PHOEBE: Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I’d be a millionaire by now, y'know.
PHOEBE: You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
LESLIE: Aw, you’re right, you’re right. I’m sorry.
PHOEBE: That’s okay. All right, I’m gonna play song that’s really, really sad. It’s called Magician Box Mix Up.

ROSS: Damn! I can’t believe I took her off my list.
MONICA: Why? ‘Cause otherwise you’d go for it?
ROSS: Yeah, maybe.
RACHEL: Oh-oh, you lie.
ROSS: What you don’t think I’d go up to her?
RACHEL: Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
ROSS: Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
RACHEL: You know what honey, you go ahead, we’ll call her an alternate.
ROSS: Okay, hold my crawler.
RACHEL: Okay.
MONICA: Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
RACHEL: Honey, he’s about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I’m just sorry we don’t got popcorn.

RACHEL: Oh that’s all right!
RACHEL: Y’know, I ended up having a really good time.
RACHEL: Y’know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
CHANDLER: So what was it for anyway?
RACHEL: I wanna say a disease.
JOEY: Hey!
ALL: Hey!
JOEY: I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on
PHOEBE: Oh my God, look! That’s Elizabeth!
RACHEL: Oh-oh Professor Geller.
JOEY: Ahh, to be 13 again.
ROSS: Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
JOEY: No! He blew us off!
ROSS: What?!
JOEY: I know!
ROSS: I can’t believe it.  Can I tell you something? I’m a little mad at him now.
JOEY: Can I tell you something? Me too.
ROSS: Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don’t talk to him
JOEY: Ooooh! Freeze him out.
ROSS: That’s right!
JOEY: I like it!
ELIZABETH: Doorknob?
ROSS: Yeah, it kinda grows on you.  Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
ELIZABETH: Oh good.
ROSS: Look, I…  Look, I’m having a great time with you and I just don’t want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us.
ROSS: So, I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet.
ROSS: It’s-it’s too soon.
ELIZABETH: Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I’m going to Florida for a couple weeks.

PHOEBE: I know, the babies are asleep.
MONICA: Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
PHOEBE: I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
MONICA: But my apartment!
CHANDLER: Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
MONICA: You’re right, you’re right I shouldn’t freak out.
MONICA: ‘Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies!
MONICA: When will that be?
CHANDLER: Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
JOEY: Hey Ross! The baby’s kicking!
ROSS: What?! It is?!
RACHEL: It’s not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again.
ROSS: Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
RACHEL: Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey’s room and he was sleeping
JOEY: A dreamless sleep.
RACHEL: So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!

PHOEBE: Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi.
PHOEBE: Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
PHOEBE: You didn’t say Boutros Boutros Gali.
MISCHA: Boutros Boutros Gali.
MISCHA: He says he was too.
PHOEBE: Interesting.
MISCHA: So I was wondering....
PHOEBE: Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
MISCHA: Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun.
MISCHA: So you're a chef?
MONICA: I’m also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
MISCHA: Oh, really.
PHOEBE: Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please.  What are you doing?
MONICA: Well, I was having a conversation.
PHOEBE: Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven’t been able to say two words to each other.
MONICA: What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
PHOEBE: That would be great. Thank you.
DANNY: so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera!
JOEY: Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
CHANDLER: When did that happen to you?!
JOEY: Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn't have my camera!
CHANDLER: Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
KRISTA: Oh, this is so good  you have got to try it.
DANNY: Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
KRISTA: Here, I'll get it.
KRISTA: We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
DANNY: Yep.  I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
RACHEL: Oh, great!
CHANDLER: Okay, bye!  Oh my God!!
MONICA: That was unbelievable!
JOEY: Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
CHANDLER: I don't believe they're brother and sister.
JOEY: They're brother and sister!!!
THE DIRECTOR: Action!
RICHARD: I found the picture!
JOEY: What picture?!
RICHARD: The picture of my wife! In your pack!
JOEY: You went through my personal property?
RICHARD: Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
JOEY: Because Vincent, we were lovers.  For two years!
THE DIRECTOR: Cut! Wonderful!
JOEY: Great scene yeah?
RICHARD: Oh you’re awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Here’s your call sheet for tomorrow.
PHOEBE: I know.
MRS. GELLER: So Chandler, your parents must’ve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
CHANDLER: Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
MR. GELLER: I remember when we first got engaged.
CHANDLER: Oh, I don’t think I ever heard that story.
MR. GELLER: Well, I’d gotten Judy pregnant. I still don’t know how that happened.
MRS. GELLER: You don’t know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
CHANDLER: What a sweet story.
MONICA: Well, at least you’re not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
MR. GELLER: What?! They wanted a scary story!
MONICA: Anyway, we’re really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we’ll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.
MONICA: What?
MRS. GELLER: You tell her Jack, I can’t do it.
MONICA: What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don’t you?
MR. GELLER: We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
PHOEBE: After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
MONICA: Did that!
PHOEBE: Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
MONICA: Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
PHOEBE: Was it not pain-free?
MONICA: No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
PHOEBE: Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad.
MONICA: That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid.
MONICA: But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest.
PHOEBE: Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
ROSS: Now umm, remember I’m still learning.
ROSS: One, two, three, four!
ROSS: You know the song! Sing along!
ROSS: So?
CHANDLER: No!
PHOEBE: Oh my God! That’s David!
MONICA: David who?
PHOEBE: David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
DAVID: Oh my God!
PHOEBE: Oh, you say someone’s name enough, they turn around.
DAVID: Phoebe?
PHOEBE: David!  What-what are you doing here? Aren’t you supposed to be in Russia?
DAVID: Yeah, I’m just, I’m just in town for a conference. Umm,
PHOEBE: Well… Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
DAVID: Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
PHOEBE: Yeah.
ROSS: Yes! Santa's coming!
ROSS: Hey, uh, I’m really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
JOEY: It’s no big deal. Hey, y’know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
ROSS: But hey, it’s not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides
JOEY: Whatever.
ROSS: Okay, Mon, back me up here.
ROSS: Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right?
ROSS: And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
MONICA: I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
JOEY: Look, Ross, really it’s-it’s no big deal.
JOEY: Y’know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can’t be friends at work, then so be it.
JOEY: Y’know, hey I understand.
JOEY: Y’know?
JOEY: Hey, when I’m in a play and you’re in the audience, I don’t talk to you, right?
JOEY: So it’s y’know, it’s uh, it’s cool.
JOEY: I’ll see you tomorrow.
RACHEL: Yeah, when we’re in the audience he doesn’t talk to us, but he does wave.
CHANDLER: You did look like an idiot.
JOEY: Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot.
JOEY: All right?
JOEY: Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?"
JOEY: And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
ROSS: Yeah that's the same.
MONICA: That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
PHOEBE: Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
MONICA: Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
CHANDLER: Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about.
CHANDLER: Y'know, for me anyway.
CHANDLER: And of course, the Indians.
MONICA: Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
PHOEBE: Hi, guys.
RACHEL: Hi! Phoebe.
MONICA: Hi Phoebe.
PHOEBE: I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.

DOUG: Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!
CHANDLER: Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
MONICA: Yes, hi.
DOUG: Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.
CHANDLER: I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’m sorry.
DOUG: Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!
MONICA: No leg-chewing for us sir.
DOUG: Oh well, give it time.
DOUG: So the divorce, the marriage, we’ve got a lot to celebrate.
DOUG: How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?
DOUG: Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six.
DOUG: They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!
MONICA: Okay, I’ll see you tomorrow!
MONICA: Just so you know, we’re not seeing him tomorrow.
MONICA: I-I cannot spend another evening with that man.
MONICA: Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
CHANDLER: No.
MONICA: That’s because he wasn’t invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
CHANDLER: Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts
EMERIL: Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs
CHANDLER: How many times have I told you guys, you
MONICA: Hi Chandler.
CHANDLER: Hey!
MONICA: Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
CHANDLER: Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
MONICA: William Sonoma
CHANDLER: Expect it in 4-6 weeks.
CHANDLER: Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
MONICA: Yeah, so?
CHANDLER: Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
MONICA: Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
CHANDLER: Why?
MONICA: Why?
CHANDLER: What's your point?
JOEY: So uh, what’s your name?
MAN: It's Jake.
JOEY: Joey.  Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
JAKE: Yeah, big fan.
JOEY: Me too! There’s a game on Tuesday, do you wanna go?
JAKE: Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I’m not doing anything Tuesday.
CAROL: Ugh.  Ross!
ROSS: Hi! Sorry I’m late. Were you sleeping?
CAROL: Ahh, nooo!!
ROSS: Oh, great!
ROSS: Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery.
ROSS: I got you the best one I could, ‘cause that’s not where you want to skimp.
CAROL: You’re a genius, Ross.
ROSS: Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
CAROL: Okay, I’ll pay you tomorrow.
ROSS: So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
CAROL: Yeah, okay, bye.
ROSS: So I’m gonna take off then!
RACHEL: Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.
DANNY: Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.
RACHEL: Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
DANNY: Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.
RACHEL: Yeah, sure.  All right, whose court is the ball in now?
MONICA: I thought there wasn't a ball?
RACHEL: Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!

TOM: I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
RACHEL: Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
RACHEL: Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
MONICA: I think I need a drink.
RACHEL: Yeah!
JOEY: Hey, Pheebs?
PHOEBE: No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
JOEY: Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again.
JOEY: And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.
JOEY: You really think I'm ready?
PHOEBE: Uh-huh!
JOEY: Wow! Cool!
JOEY: Was the chord at least right
PHOEBE: No!
JILL: Well, this has been fun.
CHANDLER: Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
JILL: Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout.  See ya.
CHANDLER: Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457.
CHANDLER: And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
LECTURER: We’re beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
ROSS: I’m really glad we came.  You’re so pretty. I love you.
ROSS: Okay, that’s a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
RACHEL: Excuse me, I’m sorry, I’m gonna have to call you back, I’ve got a Schemp in my office.
RACHEL: What are you doing?
ROSS: I’m sorry.
ROSS: But ah, hey, oh, somebody’s off the phone, how ‘bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
RACHEL: Ross you’re not listening to me, I don’t have time to stop.
ROSS: Come on Rach, you don’t have what, ten minutes?
RACHEL: I don’t have ten minutes!!
ROSS: What?  Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
RACHEL: Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don’t!
ROSS: Don’t yell at me okay, this is the most I’ve seen you all week.
RACHEL: Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I’ve got a deadline, would you just go home, I’ll talk to you later.
ROSS: Yeah, but wait...
RACHEL: Good bye!
SOPHIE: Actually, that’s our three hole punch.
MONICA: Oh yeah? When?
CHANDLER: I'll tell you what.
CHANDLER: When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
MONICA: Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
CHANDLER: Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
MONICA: Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
CHANDLER: No, no, no.
MONICA: What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
CHANDLER: Uh, uh.
MONICA: Well?
CHANDLER: Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
RACHEL: Hey.
PHOEBE: Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
MONICA: Did you go home and change?
RACHEL: Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
MONICA: No, I haven't seen him.
RACHEL: Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here.  What if the baby needs him?
CHANDLER: Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
RACHEL: Yeah, why?
CHANDLER: No reason.
ROSS: I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas!
MONICA: What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
THE WOMAN: Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
CHANDLER: Yeah, that’s her.
THE WOMAN: Thank you.
MONICA: It’s unbelievable! I-I can’t believe that sign didn’t work!
CHANDLER: Y’know what would work?
CHANDLER: Stop making candy!
CHANDLER: You mean they like you.
MONICA: Maybe.
CHANDLER: Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
MONICA: Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
MONICA: We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled ‘CUT!’
RACHEL: Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
MONICA: Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
RACHEL: ‘Cos I was gonna say there’s no way you could’ve done the end the way you guys did it back then!
MONICA: What? We could do it!
ROSS: I don’t know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
MONICA: I can do it, okay? Come on, let’s go.
MONICA AND ROSS: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
MONICA: I can’t do it!
CHANDLER: Now you do that, you’re on TV.
JOEY: Hey!
THE VENDOR: So, what are you guys in the market for? We’ve got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
JOEY: Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. That’s the stuff. What do you think?
CHANDLER: Well, I don’t have to buy that, "I’m with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
JOEY: Well, I like it. Here you go.
CHANDLER: All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?
JOEY: Oh, I embarrass you?
CHANDLER: How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?
CHANDLER: Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
THE VENDOR: They’re all tourists.
CHANDLER: All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y’know, you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
JOEY: Oh yeah?  If you’re gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
THE VENDOR: Good choice.
JOEY: Thanks.
CHANDLER: Okay, wait. All right, that’s it, okay, I’m out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
MONICA: So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
JULIO: What?
MONICA: Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.
MONICA: And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my
JULIO: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
MONICA: You don't even know me...
JULIO: Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
MONICA: What?
JULIO: The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
MONICA: I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
JULIO: No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
MONICA: Oh yeah.
ROSS: Okay, forward. Forward—Stop!  Okay, back—Stop!  Okay, forward—Stop! Stop! Stop!
PHOEBE: Okay, here’s what we’re gonna do.
PHOEBE: Okay, I’m gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral.
PHOEBE: You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot.
PHOEBE: Okay?
PHOEBE: All right, here we go.
PHOEBE: Haul ass!!!
ROSS: So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain.
ROSS: So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
JANINE: ...and live forever as a machine!
ROSS: That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?
ROSS: You and I, we're interfacing.
JANINE: Yeah, I gotta go.
CHANDLER: Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
MONICA: David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
DAVID: Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.
MONICA: See?
CHANDLER: Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
MONICA: Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
PHOEBE: Oh, I should go, too.
PHOEBE: Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
PHOEBE: Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there.
PHOEBE: And she was like "Oh, don't worry!
PHOEBE: I asked him.
PHOEBE: He's totally ok with seeing you!".
PHOEBE: So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
RACHEL: Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
PHOEBE: Exactly!
RACHEL: And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
PHOEBE: I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh,
RACHEL: Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
PHOEBE: Ok, that'll be great!
JOEY: Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
RACHEL: That's not what we're gonna do!
JOEY: Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
CHANDLER: Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
JULIE: Hello Skidmark.
CHANDLER: It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later.
MONICA: It’s pretty clear.
CHANDLER: Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
JULIE: That’s why you broke up with me?
CHANDLER: You-you-you didn’t know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!
ROSS: Ni-chou chi-ma!
RACHEL: Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
ROSS: Hi everyone.
ROSS: I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.
ROSS: Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
RACHEL: What did, what did he say?
ROSS: Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know.
ROSS: So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so.
PHOEBE: Oh, great!
PHOEBE: We couldn’t keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y’know, he’d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
MONICA: Okay, stop it Phoebe, you’re getting me all tingly.
PHOEBE: All I could think of was y’know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
MONICA: And did he?
PHOEBE: I’m a lady Monica, I don’t kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
MONICA: Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
PHOEBE: I just like him so much that I just feel like I’ve had 10 drinks today and I’ve only had six.
MONICA: Oh, I haven’t had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler.
MONICA: Wow, I’m never gonna have that feeling again, am I?
PHOEBE: You sound like a guy.
MONICA: No, a guy would be saying, "I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."
MONICA: Oh my God!
MONICA: I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!
MONICA: I’ve been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I’d be giving up!
MONICA: I mean, I…I’m never gonna have a first kiss again.
PHOEBE: You’ll have a last kiss.
ROSS: Thank you so much for coming back over.
MONA: Oh good, you’re here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
RACHEL: I know Mona, just hear me out.
RACHEL: First of all, I’m so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own.
RACHEL: You’re gonna have to tell me how you did that.
ROSS: Focus.
RACHEL: Okay. Um…But—Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are
JOEY: All right where’s that turkey!
PHOEBE: Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
JOEY: Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
PHOEBE: No.
PHOEBE: No!
PHOEBE: Oh, would you look at that Monica?
PHOEBE: I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.
MONICA: Okay, I’m next.  Don’t! Don’t start another game! I said I’m next! Phoebe!
PHOEBE: Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t hear you over all the winning.
MONICA: Chandler! Phoebe’s hogging the game!
RACHEL: Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
JOEY: Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
MONICA: Anyway, it just doesn’t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It’s a lot of work.
JOEY: But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!
JOEY: I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!
JOEY: Or Friday with no two pizzas!
MONICA: All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just—there’s gonna be a ton left over.
JOEY: No there won’t! I promise I will finish that turkey!
MONICA: All right, you’re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
JOEY: That’s right!
JOEY: ‘Cause I’m a Tribbiani!
JOEY: And this is what we do!
JOEY: We can eat!
PHOEBE: Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
CHANDLER: Look at this!
PHOEBE: Oh! You have a window!
CHANDLER: Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...
PHOEBE: Oh look! That guy's peeing!
MONICA: Hi.
RACHEL: Hi.
RACHEL: Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
RACHEL: Okay. Let’s use this brush.
ROSS: Okay. This stuff?
RACHEL: Yeah.
ROSS: All right.
RACHEL: Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
JOEY: Okay-Dokey
ROSS: Where exactly is your zoo?
DR. BALDHARA: Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience.
DR. BALDHARA: Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
ROSS: Yes.
DR. BALDHARA: Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
ROSS: No-no, he's, he's very docile.
DR. BALDHARA: Even if he were... cornered?
ROSS: Well I, I don't know. Why?
DR. BALDHARA: Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
ROSS: He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
DR. BALDHARA: How about a hammer, or a small blade?
DR. BALDHARA: Otherwise it's just cruel.
JOEY: He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
JOEY: We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
CHANDLER: ...He's in.
ROSS: He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
DR. BALDHARA: You're making a big mistake here.
DR. BALDHARA: I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
CHANDLER: My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.
CHANDLER: Really helped speed the process along!
CHANDLER: Janice!
CHANDLER: You're not... gone?
JANICE: Sid is still in his room.
JANICE: I don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him.
JANICE: So did you do it?
JANICE: Did you make your deposit?
CHANDLER: Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
JANICE: That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
CHANDLER: I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
JANICE: Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
MONICA: Phoebe, where's your purse?
MONICA: No, no! Give it to me!
PHOEBE: You can't have it.
MONICA: Give it to me!
PHOEBE: No
MONICA: I'll go in there.
PHOEBE: Oh yeah.
MONICA: Phoebe come here
MONICA: Haha!
PHOEBE: Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
MONICA: What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
YOUNG ETHAN: I just had sex.
MONICA: Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
YOUNG ETHAN: Well, you never told me how old you were.
MONICA: Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
YOUNG ETHAN: I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
MONICA: Don't say it.
YOUNG ETHAN: ...in love with you.
MONICA: Really?
YOUNG ETHAN: Sorry.
MONICA: Well,fall out of it.
MONICA: You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night.
MONICA: Oh god, oh god.
MONICA: I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad.
MONICA: I'm Joan Collins.
YOUNG ETHAN: Who?
RACHEL: That’s right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room!
ROSS: Uh sweetie, maybe you’d be more comfortable here?
RACHEL: You. Like you haven’t done enough.
ROSS: Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.
ROSS: I mean I wish I were a seahorse.
ROSS: Because with seahorses it’s the male, they carry the babies.
ROSS: And then also umm, I’d be far away in the sea.
RACHEL: God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
PHOEBE: Oh I know, I’ve been there. I remember toward the end
RACHEL: Oh Phoebe, that’s a great story.
RACHEL: Can you tell it to me when you’re getting me some iced tea?
RACHEL: Oh God, get out!
RACHEL: Get out!!
RACHEL: Get out!!
RACHEL: Get out!
CHANDLER: Let’s.
JOEY: All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it’ll be okay.
RACHEL: Oh my God….What’s he gonna do now?
RACHEL: I can’t watch!
RACHEL: Oh.
RACHEL: Seriously, how can you watch this?
RACHEL: Aren’t you scared?
JOEY: Terrified.
CHANDLER: Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
MONICA: Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
CHANDLER: Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse?
CHANDLER: Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine.
CHANDLER: I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
MONICA: Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I
CHANDLER: Fine! Maybe I will too!
DR. LEEDBETTER: Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
ROSS: You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!
ROSS: MY SANDWICH?!!!
ROSS: MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
JOEY: What’s the matter, Pheebs?
PHOEBE: She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
JOEY: What?!
PHOEBE: Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.
PHOEBE: She’s avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is.
PHOEBE: She knows, and she won’t tell me.
RACHEL: Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
PHOEBE: Yeah, well, don’t “Aww Pheebs, that sucks!” me yet.
CHANDLER: Where ya going?
PHOEBE: Well, she’s out of town so, there’s gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
ROSS: Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
PHOEBE: Well, are any of those people here?!
PHOEBE: Oh my God, so do I!
PHOEBE SR.: I knew it, wow!!
PHOEBE: Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
PHOEBE SR.: Ohh, so cute.
PHOEBE: Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I’m-I’m mad at you.
PHOEBE SR.: I know. I’m mad at me too.
PHOEBE: Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I’m kinda hungry.
PHOEBE SR.: Hey! Me too!
PHOEBE: All right, stop it. Now you’re just doing it to freak me out.
PHOEBE: Ok, you can do this.
PHOEBE: It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.
PHOEBE: Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
CHANDLER: Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
JANICE: All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it.
PHOEBE: Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
MONICA: Really?  My God, he’s really cute.
PHOEBE: Go for it.
MONICA: Phoebe, I’m engaged!
PHOEBE: I’m just saying, get his number just in case.
PHOEBE: But no: Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
MONICA: Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I’m engaged.
MONICA: Well you should be embarrassed.
PHOEBE: I did, but that was really fun.
CHANDLER: Hey.
ROSS: Chandler. I sensed it was you.
CHANDLER: What?!
ROSS: Unagi. I’m always aware.
CHANDLER: Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?
ROSS: What’s up?
CHANDLER: I can’t figure out what to make Monica.
ROSS: Oh, why don’t you make her one of your little jokes.
CHANDLER: I’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
ROSS: Y’know what?
ROSS: She’d-she’d love this.
ROSS: Uh, it’s an exact replica of Apollo 8.
ROSS: I made it in the sixth grade.
CHANDLER: Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
ROSS: Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon.
ROSS: But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
CHANDLER: Wait a minute, I can’t give this to her.
ROSS: Why not?
CHANDLER: Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
JANICE: Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
MONICA: He might still show up.
JANICE: Oh, what are you, stupid? It’s been three hours.
MONICA: Is that all?
JANICE: I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don’t you tell about your lovely wedding?
CHANDLER: Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding.
CHANDLER: Um, it’s going to be a small ceremony.
CHANDLER: Uh, tiny!
CHANDLER: We’re not even sure why we’re having it.
MONICA: It’s actually going to be just family.
JANICE: Oh…wait…you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing
ROSS: Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
RACHEL: Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
ROSS: Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
RACHEL: Well, I brought the next best thing.
RACHEL: Whoa!  Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
KATIE: Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
RACHEL: Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
KATIE: You're so sweet!
RACHEL: Ohh, you're so sweet!
KATIE: Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
JOEY: Huh.
KATIE: Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
JOEY: Uhh….
KATIE: You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
JOEY: Nah.
PHOEBE: How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape—, a rapist or a killer or something!
JOEY: Don’t you think I asked him that before he got in?!
PHOEBE: Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?!
HITCHHIKER: No!
PHOEBE: Do you like car games?
HITCHHIKER: Yeah, y’know the license plate game?
PHOEBE: I
JOEY: Ooh, I’ll play! I’ll play!
PHOEBE: No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!
CHANDLER: Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica?
CHANDLER: I can’t figure this out!
CHANDLER: It’s so hard!
CHANDLER: Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah!
CHANDLER: Paper cut!
PHOEBE: Now, have you told anyone else?
CHANDLER: No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out.
PHOEBE: You told me.
CHANDLER: Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
PHOEBE: Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t been on the toilet.
CHANDLER: Me too.
JOEY: Hey.
CHANDLER: Hey.
PHOEBE: Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?
CHANDLER: Oh all right.
ROSS: Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
CHANDLER: Oh well, we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place.
ROSS: How rude.
JOEY: Oh, I’m sorry. You wanna bite?
JOEY: The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
CHANDLER: What?
JOEY: The ring is gone!
CHANDLER: Ugh.
CHANDLER: Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this—Ah-ha-ha!!
CHANDLER: You lost the ring!
CHANDLER: You’re the worst best man ever!
JOEY: Dude, this isn’t funny!
JOEY: What am I gonna do?!
JOEY: I go to bed last night, everything’s cool!
JOEY: I wake up this morning, the stripper’s gone and the ring is gone!
CHANDLER: You slept with the stripper?
JOEY: Of course!!
ROSS: What difference does that make?!
JOEY: Well, I'm just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
RACHEL: Joey, do you have a minute?
ROSS: Dude, what am I gonna
JOEY: Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
RACHEL: Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
JOEY: Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
RACHEL: Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have
JOEY: What-what is it, what is it?
RACHEL: Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
JOEY: Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
RACHEL: Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
JOEY: I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
RACHEL: What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
JOEY: And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
RACHEL: I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone
JOEY: I'm not listening to you!
RACHEL: Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!
RACHEL: Hey, come on now!
JOEY: All right, what are we havin’?
JOEY: Uhh, I don’t believe in these crazy diets y’know, just everything in moderation.
JOEY: I’ll take those to go.  For the kids.
THE INTERVIEWER: Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?
JOEY: It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn’t have said.
JOEY: But believe me, that’s not gonna happen today.
THE INTERVIEWER: Understood. So, what’d you say back then?
JOEY: Well, I said that I
RACHEL: Ha!
PHOEBE: So you like the drums!
PHOEBE: That's, that's great!
PHOEBE: Y’know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation.
PHOEBE: All right, okay, well, apparently not!
PHOEBE: So, yay!
JOEY: Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  Ready? One, two, three, four...
JOEY: Tequila!!
PHOEBE: That's fun.
JOEY: Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
RACHEL: Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
JOEY: I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
MONICA: Joey, please don’t do that. I think it’s best that we just forget about it.
RACHEL: That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed.
JOEY: All right that’s it, school is in session!
MONICA: My God! Is this a gym card?
CHANDLER: Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I’ve missed the last 1200 times.
ROSS: So why don’t you quit?
CHANDLER: You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I
ROSS: Who is Maria?
CHANDLER: Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her, she’s like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat.
ROSS: You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
CHANDLER: No!
ROSS: So you’re strong enough to face her on your own?
CHANDLER: Oh no, you’ll have to come.
RACHEL: Pheebs, I don’t think anyone's mad about that.
PHOEBE: Exactly! Because it's in the past!
JOEY: Anybody gonna eat that?
JOEY: Pheebs!
PHOEBE: Hey!
JOEY: Listen, you know how uh, when you’re wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
PHOEBE: Yeah!
JOEY: Well, when Jake did it I saw that…he was wearing women’s underwear!
PHOEBE: I know. They were mine.
JOEY: Oh.  No! No wait, that’s weird!
PHOEBE: No, it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
JOEY: That’s weird!
PHOEBE: I’m wearing his briefs right now.
JOEY: That’s…kinda hot.
PHOEBE: I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
JOEY: Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that.
PHOEBE: And! Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
JOEY: Yeah well next thing you know, he’ll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
PHOEBE: There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinking even more than you.
JOEY: Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.
PHOEBE: I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear!
PHOEBE: I don’t think you could ever do that.
JOEY: Hey! I
PHOEBE: Okay, whatever.
PHOEBE: Lusts of the flesh.
RACHEL: What?
PHOEBE: I don’t know.  A cowboy theme?
JOEY: Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
RACHEL: Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!
JOEY: Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya.
RACHEL: Hey!
NURSE: Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?
RACHEL: Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won’t take my  breast?
NURSE: It’s all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it,  but don’t worry. It’ll happen.
JOEY: Yowza
RACHEL: Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your  mouth.
JOEY: Dear Lord.
RACHEL: I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?
JOEY: Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…
RACHEL: Do you think my nipples are  too big for her mouth?
RACHEL: She looks scared.
RACHEL: Doesn’t she  look scared?
JOEY: Y’know, I don’t really know her.
CHANDLER: Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
RACHEL: No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
PHOEBE: Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
CHANDLER: Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the "a-gogo."
JOEY: Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
CHANDLER: Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
JOEY: No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me.
JOEY: The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
CHANDLER: Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
JOEY: Pathetic mess?
JOEY: I know, but—come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable.
JOEY: I'm thinkin', cha-ching!
JOEY: Thanks.
JOEY: Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice.
JOEY: You're doin' this.
ROSS: Hi. She said yes.
CHANDLER: Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh?
JOEY: "Happy birthday to you!"
GUNTHER: You’re paying for that.
JOEY: What? No-no it’s her birthday!
GUNTHER: You’ve sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
JOEY: But it really
GUNTHER: You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
JOEY: Damnit!
ROSS: Rach? Hi!
RACHEL: Hi!
ROSS: Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
RACHEL: Well yeah
ROSS: Oh wow!
ROSS: I mean, wow!
ROSS: I mean, I-I-I think she’s cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
RACHEL: Really?!
ROSS: Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
RACHEL: Oh so-so not really never.
ROSS: I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am.
ROSS: I mean after all we’ve been through, I just—y’know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.
ROSS: Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
JOEY: Oh-ho, and mine!
PHOEBE: No-no wait-wait! I can’t just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
EARL: Well…I only have one thing to do today.  I guess I could push it back.
PHOEBE: Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
EARL: It’s just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
PHOEBE: Chandler?
EARL: I-I’m sorry?
PHOEBE: No look, I-I’m sure that people know you exist!
EARL: Oh yeah?
EARL: I work in a cubicle surrounded by people.
EARL: I’ve been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one’s even looked up from their desk.
EARL: Hang-hang on.
EARL: Hey everybody!
EARL: Uh, I’m gonna kill myself!
EARL: I got nothing.
JOEY: Apparently, there’s like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there’s only this one robot and this one guy who controls it!
JOEY: I didn’t know he could get me fired!
JOEY: What am I going to do?
MONICA: Well y’know Joey, you’re a pretty charming guy.
JOEY: Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
MONICA: No sweetie, you’ve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You’ve got to kiss some serious robot ass!
JOEY: That’s not a bad idea.
JOEY: Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I’m not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.
JOEY: Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
CHANDLER: So do you think uh, Joey’s more charming than me?
MONICA: Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side.
CHANDLER: Yeah, you wish.
PHOEBE: "You wish."
PAUL: Why are you yelling?
RACHEL: Whoa, that
JOEY: Whoa-whoa, what is it?
PHOEBE: Well… It’s a date.
JOEY: A date?!
JOEY: No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn’t schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
PHOEBE: Come on Joey, don’t make me feel badly about this.
JOEY: No, I’m gonna!!
JOEY: That’s right!
JOEY: Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin’ out with that girl!
JOEY: Like-like-like I did something terrible to you!
JOEY: And now Pheebs, you’re doing the same thing!
PHOEBE: That—It’s not the same thing! This is
JOEY: Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
PHOEBE: She was?
JOEY: Well, she graduated from high school!
PHOEBE: Okay, whatever.
PHOEBE: Y’know what?
PHOEBE: I don’t have time to convince you because he’s only here for four hours, and I’m gonna go see him!
JOEY: Fine!
PHOEBE: Yeah!
JOEY: Fine!
PHOEBE: Yeah!
JOEY: What are you still doin’ here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!
ROSS: Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.

PHOEBE: Yes!
MONICA: All right.
MONICA: Let go!
ROSS: No! You let go!
ROSS: How come it’s always us left in the field holding the ball?
MONICA: I don’t know. I guess the other people just don’t care enough.
ROSS: Hey! It’s starting to snow.
ROSS: Gimme the this!
MONICA: Let go!
JOEY: Y'know what?
CHANDLER: Umm?
JOEY: I bet ‘ya ya I could fit in there.
CHANDLER: I’ve got five bucks says you can’t.
JOEY: Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
LYDIA: Knick fan?

LYDIA: Oh, boy, do they suck.
JOEY: Hey, listen, lady.......whoa.
LYDIA: Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat.
JOEY: Oh yeah? And who do you like?
LYDIA: The Celtics.
JOEY: The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?
LYDIA: Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!

BARRY: Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
BERNICE: Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.

RACHEL: Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels
MINDY: Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
RACHEL: What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
MINDY: Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
RACHEL: Oh God.
MINDY: I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
RACHEL: And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
PHOEBE: Listen, Robert’s gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
ROSS: Oh.
PHOEBE: Please, right now, no, every time I see him it’s like ‘Is it on the lose?’ ‘Is it watching me?’
CHANDLER: We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
ROSS: He’s right, even if it’s to say something complementary.
ROBERT: Hey!
PHOEBE: Hey.
ROBERT: So are ready for the gym? They’ve got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other.
PHOEBE: No, I can spot you from here.
ROBERT: What?
PHOEBE: Okay, listen Robert...
PHOEBE: I don’t have time for this.
MONICA: No, that is what the game is.
PHOEBE: Which you just gave up really quickly.
CHANDLER: Have you seen Joey?
MONICA: What’s the matter?
CHANDLER: Oh, just this!  Y’know what it’s my fault really, because the couch is usually where we
JOEY: Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
CHANDLER: What’s going on?
MONICA: He’s retiling my floor.
CHANDLER: Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
MONICA: Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
CHANDLER: He started mine first!
PHOEBE: Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.
CHANDLER: Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
ISSAC: Can I help you?
CHANDLER: Uh-oh.
JOEY: Uh, y'know what, we’re having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we’ll need a little more time to think about it.
ISSAC: Chloe, switch with me, there’s some guys here that got a crush on you.
CHANDLER: Okay, that hurt us.
CHLOE: Hi guys. I haven’t seen you since this morning.
CHANDLER: Well ah, ........y'know.
CHLOE: Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
JOEY: Both of us?
CHLOE: Maybe. Does that scare ya?
CHLOE: Relax. It’s just Issac’s D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should come.
JOEY: We’ll be there.
CHLOE: Great. I’ll ah, see ya then.
CHANDLER: All right, rock on.
ROSS: Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great.
ROSS: ‘Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know.
ROSS: Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
CAROL: Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.
CAROL: Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
ROSS: Oh yeah, I’d love that.
CAROL: Oh, great! Me too.
ROSS: I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
ROSS: And why do you care so much?
MONICA: Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
ROSS: You had fantasies about Emily?
MONICA: No! Y’know,
ROSS: Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
MONICA: Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
MONICA: Do you love her?
ROSS: We said it was only going to be two weeks, y’know?
MONICA: You love her!
ROSS: What-what is love really?

CHANDLER: When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me!
CHANDLER: Look, things like last night they don’t just happen.
CHANDLER: Or at least not to me.
CHANDLER: Or with the other two women, in the morning y’know I was just lying there and I couldn’t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y’know with a friend.
MONICA: Chandler!
CHANDLER: I know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a "doctor…"
MONICA: There was just one woman, wasn’t there?
CHANDLER: No, there were two.
MONICA: Including me?
CHANDLER: Oh yeah.

JOEY: Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn’t go out with a guy like Chandler...
CHANDLER: Hi there.
JOEY: ...and he couldn’t let it go, and... I don’t really know what happened with that either.
JOEY: And then Ross’s new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head.

DR. LEDBETTER: I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
ROSS: Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
DR. LEDBETTER: I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?

CHANDLER: So, how many have you sold so far?
ROSS: Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
CHANDLER: Oh my God, how did you do that?
ROSS: Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as ‘Laser Floyd’ was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes!
ROSS: That’s when it occurred to me, the key to my success, ‘the munchies.’ So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight.

CHANDLER: Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said
ROSS: Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check.
ROSS: And then you said, "Why do they call it a check?
ROSS: Why not a Yugoslavian?"
ROSS: Yeah, then you did that.
CHANDLER: So you don’t have the cameras?!
ROSS: No. Sorry man.
CHANDLER: So? What? What? They’re gone! Monica’s gonna freak!

CHANDLER: Okay, I’m not gonna have one.
PHOEBE: No, no, it’s just my tooth.
CHANDLER: All right I’ll have one.
ROSS: So what’s a matter, you need a dentist? I’ve got a good one.
PHOEBE: No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can’t see him.
CHANDLER: See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
ROSS: Why? Why can’t you go to him?
PHOEBE: Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
CHANDLER: That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist’s blouse.
RACHEL: Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
PHOEBE: Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend ‘Albino Bob’.
RACHEL: And all these people actually died?
PHOEBE: Yes, while I was in the chair!
PHOEBE: That’s why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it’s not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
ROSS: Pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist.
ROSS: It’s, it’s, it’s just ah, a coincidence.
PHOEBE: Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t, their dead.
ROSS: Hello?
EMILY: Ross.
EMILY: It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
ROSS: No, no, that-that, that’s all right. Umm, I’m just glad you called.
EMILY: Ross umm, there’s something that I’ve got to tell you, there’s-there’s someone else.
ROSS: Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
MONICA: You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
ROSS: Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
CHANDLER: So, let's go.
ROSS: Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
CHANDLER: Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now.
MONICA: You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
ROSS: Okay, I’ve got three of my five.
RACHEL: Three of your five, what?
ROSS: Celebrities I’m allowed to sleep with.
RACHEL: Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
ROSS: Yeah, it’s hard okay, I only have two spots left.
CHANDLER: All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
ROSS: Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
CHANDLER: Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
ROSS: Susan Sarandon.
CHANDLER: Eh, y'know what, she’s to political, she probably wouldn’t let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
ROSS: And!! Isabella Rosselini.
CHANDLER: Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she’s too international, y'know she’s never gonna be around.
RACHEL: So?
CHANDLER: So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who’s gonna be in the country like all the time.
RACHEL: Yeah, ‘cause that’s why you won’t get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
RACHEL: Oh that’s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn’t she want to come out?
ROSS: Y’know what I think it is?
ROSS: I think you’ve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn’t want to leave.
RACHEL: Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
DR. LONG: Twenty-one hours, you’re a hero.
RACHEL: Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
DR. LONG: Actually, I think you’re ready to go to the delivery room.
RACHEL: What?
DR. LONG: Ten centimeters, you’re about to become a mom.
RACHEL: My God. Okay.  Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
CAROL: Are they here yet?
RACHEL: No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
CAROL: Ok.
RACHEL: Hi.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: May I see your boarding pass?
RACHEL: Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.

CHANDLER: I'm like the bing, bing, bing.
CHANDLER: You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
JANICE: Ow!
CHANDLER: Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
JANICE: Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
CHANDLER: I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
PHOEBE: Oh my god.  How many of those have you had?
CHANDLER: Oh, I don't know, a million?
PHOEBE: Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
CHANDLER: I'm fine.
PHOEBE: All right.
CHANDLER: I'm not fine. Here she comes.
PHOEBE: Wait here. Breathe.
CHANDLER: How do you do that?
PHOEBE: It's like a gift.
CHANDLER: We should always always break up together.
PHOEBE: Oh, I'd like that.
CHANDLER: You win.
JOEY: Well, what did you have?
CHANDLER: It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six.
CHANDLER: That my friend is D-Cup.
CHANDLER: Okay, now much have you won so far?
JOEY: Uh,  wow, 700.
CHANDLER: Not 700 exactly?
JOEY: Yeah.
CHANDLER: Double it!
JOEY: What?
CHANDLER: Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
JOEY: Really?
CHANDLER: Hey, I didn’t make up the rules.
CHANDLER: Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card.
CHANDLER: Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.
CHANDLER: Don’t get to excited because that’s not gonna happen unless you get—No way!
ROSS: I’m, I’m sorry you didn’t get to go to Spacecamp, and I’m hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it.

JOEY: Y’know it wouldn’t kill ya to respect your wife’s privacy!
JOEY: Stupid closet full of bugs!

JOEY: Take a couple deep breaths.
JOEY: Look confident.
RACHEL: Joey? What’s up?
JOEY: I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.
RACHEL: Okay what’s up?
CHANDLER: What I do do…is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.
PHOEBE: I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
CHANDLER: Hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.
PHOEBE: You gotta go!
CHANDLER: Oh!
PHOEBE: Okay, don’t worry. You’re ready.
CHANDLER: Really?
PHOEBE: Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you’ll be great.
MONICA: Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really.
MONICA: Yeah, Ross is great.
MONICA: He's uh, he's in a whole other place.
MONICA: No, he's gone.
MONICA: No no, you don't have to fly back, really.
MONICA: What do you mean this might be your only chance?
MONICA: Would you stop?
MONICA: I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
CHANDLER: Where have you been?
JOEY: Oh, just had a baby.
CHANDLER: Mazel tov!
ROSS: Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
CHANDLER: Oh yeah! With who?
ROSS: You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
ROSS: Not her.
ROSS: Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can’t decide between the two of them.
ROSS: Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun.
ROSS: But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown.
ROSS: Y’know she’s, well she’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s
PHOEBE: If she’s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
ROSS: Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y’know?
ROSS: She lives so close.
ROSS: And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny.
ROSS: On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding, she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist.
ROSS: Hey!
PHOEBE: Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
JOEY: Damn!
PHOEBE: Oh here’s a whole bunch.
RACHEL: Oh, I mean she’s gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl."
RACHEL: Then she’ll have to come back here and live all alone.
PHOEBE: Oh my God!
RACHEL: What?
PHOEBE: There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it’s positive. Monica’s pregnant.  So I guess she won’t be totally alone.
PHOEBE: Hi.
PHOEBE: Listen, I’m sorry about that whole thing with Roger.
PHOEBE: It really wasn’t right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think you’ll really enjoy.
PHOEBE: Now, this is just a loan.
PHOEBE: Okay?
PHOEBE: I’m gonna, I’m gonna want him back.
PHOEBE: So…  I’m gonna go now.
PHOEBE: I’m sorry, I thought I could do it and I can’t!
MONICA: All right, well why don’t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
JOEY: Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
CHANDLER: All right ladies, here’s what we’re gonna do.
PHOEBE: I-I wanna be with her,  I like her.
CHANDLER: Oh, that’s fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
MONICA: Wait, now, what am I doing again?
CHANDLER: Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
THE CIGARETTE GUY: Hi, I’m Joshua, I’m here to pick up Rachel.
RACHEL: No-no-no, that’ not Joshua.
CHANDLER: What do you want from me, I’ve never met the guy.
CHANDLER: So anyway, Rachel, I’m sorry you can’t stay,  but the rest of us have a
JOEY: How do I look?
CHANDLER: Oh, uh, I... don't... care.
CHANDLER: Ok, now, remember, no trading.
CHANDLER: You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
LORRAINE: Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
CHANDLER: ...And what did you bring?
LORRAINE: She's checking the coats.
LORRAINE: Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands.
LORRAINE: Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
CHANDLER: Janice?
JANICE: Oh.... my.... God.
CHANDLER: Hey, it's Janice.
ROSS: Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?
PHOEBE: Rachel is one of my closest friends.  Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
RACHEL: Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
PHOEBE: Hey Rach!
RACHEL: What was that?!
PHOEBE: Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
RACHEL: I haven’t seen it yet!
PHOEBE: Well then you’d better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
JOEY: No
ALL: Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
JOEY: Uh, okay, Pheebs?
PHOEBE: Yeah?
JOEY: Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
PHOEBE: Yeah?
JOEY: All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
PHOEBE: Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
MONICA: Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
JOEY: Yeah, all of us! All day!
PHOEBE: That sucks!
PHOEBE: That's not a trip!
PHOEBE: I just came from the park!
PHOEBE: What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park?
PHOEBE: "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
CHANDLER: Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
RACHEL: Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey!
RACHEL: Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just—y'know—stop it!
CHANDLER: I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
PHOEBE: That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
MONICA: Makes me wanna puke!
PHOEBE: Is she in there?
ROSS: Yeah. She’s putting her down now, that’s her.
RACHEL: Oh it’s all right.
RACHEL: I’m guess I’m just done with the whole dating thing.
RACHEL: It’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely different.
RACHEL: This is hard.
ROSS: Yeah I know.
ROSS: On the other hand in um, in about seven months you’re gonna have something that you’re gonna love more than any guy you’ve ever gone out with.
ROSS: Just wait.
ROSS: Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger.
ROSS: You have no idea.
RACHEL: Thanks sweetie.
ROSS: You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?
RACHEL: Oh no, I think I’m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.
ROSS: Hey, I thought I cheered you up.
RACHEL: Oh you did, there are twenty in here.
ROSS: Right. Good night.
RACHEL: Good night.
MRS. GELLER: Hi
ROSS: Hi!  Hey mom.
RACHEL: This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?
MRS. GELLER: Jack?
MR. GELLER: Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick?
ROSS: That’s a good question, dad. That’s a good question
AN: Congratulations you two!
RACHEL: Thank you…we’re so excited
AN: And also, congratulations on your wedding.
ROSS: Wha—What?
JOEY: Look at this clown!
JOEY: Just because he’s got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river.
JOEY: Get out of the way jackass!
JOEY: Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?
RACHEL: That
JOEY: What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there.
CHANDLER: Hey!
PHOEBE: Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
JOEY: Dude! What are yo—you trying to kill me?!
MONICA: Ow!
RICHARD: Really?! Well, it’s just like everyone else’s apartment. It’s got rooms, walls, and ceilings.
RICHARD’S DATE: Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
MONICA: Oh my God! Oh my God!
RICHARD: Ah well, this is the living room.
RICHARD: All right. This is the kitchen.
RICHARD: The bedroom. Well it’s pretty much your typical...  bedroom.
RICHARD’S DATE: We’re still on this side of the door.
JOEY: Ha-ha
RICHARD’S DATE: Yeah, but I didn’t get to see it.
RICHARD: Oh shoot! Maybe next time.  Thanks for a lovely evening.
MONICA: So um, who was she?
RICHARD: Oh,  that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
MONICA: Did you like her? And I’m just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
RICHARD: Well, you seem fine.
FRANK: Well, I don’t think this, y'know.
PHOEBE: No, no, no, I wouldn’t do you myself, I mean that would be weird.
PHOEBE: Yeah, no, I’ll get one of the other girls to do it.
PHOEBE: Oh, this will be so much fun!
PHOEBE: Hey!
PHOEBE: Are you excited?
FRANK: Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
PHOEBE: Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
MONICA: All I have is, is oregano and a
PHOEBE: Um, that's ok!  Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
RACHEL: Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
MONICA: Can we just start throwing things in?
PHOEBE: Ok, yeah, ok.  Oh, OK.
RACHEL: Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
PHOEBE: Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
MONICA: Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
RACHEL: Hey he's wearing a sweater.
MONICA: No.
RACHEL AND PHOEBE: Eww!
RACHEL: And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
MONICA: Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
ROSS: Mona?  Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be?
MONA: I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.
MONA'S DATE: Oh, it’s okay.
MONA: No, it’s still wet.
MONA: Let me get it out before it sets.
MONA: Ooh, I have something you can wear.
MONA: Here.
MONA'S DATE: Oh umm, I-I don’t know if I want to wear a woman’s shirt.
MONA: No-no that’s a man’s shirt.
MONA'S DATE: It’s awfully pink.
JOEY: Oh, it's perfect!
ROSS: How about you?
CHANDLER: It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
ROSS: All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
CHANDLER: We are bad people.
JOEY: He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew!  You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
MONICA: Let’s get the show on it!
RACHEL: Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
MONICA: Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it’s sooo close.
RACHEL: Closer than here?
PHOEBE: Oh, hey, look, I found coffee!  Okay, let’s skedaddle.
RACHEL: Wait, I’m not just gonna drink somebody’s old coffee.
PHOEBE: Okay, your highness.
PHOEBE: Um, Rachel I’m really sorry.  That’s okay, do you wanna get back together?  Yeah, okay.  Did anyone else hear that?!
LYDIA: So how did you know I was even here?
GUY: Your mom called me. So is this her?
LYDIA: No, this is a loaner.
GUY: I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
LYDIA: I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy.  So, did you see who won the game?
GUY: Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
LYDIA: Yeah, they're not so bad.
PHOEBE: I’m sorry I won’t be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I’m
RACHEL: I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn’t want him to start yelling at me like I was some ’74 Latour.
PHOEBE: It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
RACHEL: All right here he comes. I’m gonna do this, I’m gonna tell him, I’m gonna be strong.
DR. GREEN: I just called a friend of mine.
RACHEL: Yeah?
DR. GREEN: I think I may be able to book
RACHEL: Really?!
DR. GREEN: What is it sweetie?
RACHEL: There’s not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
RACHEL: I’m sorry daddy.
DR. GREEN: I don’t believe this!!
RACHEL: Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.
DR. GREEN: Stay calm?!!
DR. GREEN: How do you expect me to stay calm?!
DR. GREEN: This is unacceptable Rachel!
DR. GREEN: And I wanna know why?!!
DR. GREEN: Is it because that punk Ross won’t marry you?!
DR. GREEN: That’s it!
DR. GREEN: Is that it?
RACHEL: Yes. Yes, he says I’m damaged goods.
PHOEBE: So, you’re like a zillionaire?
CHANDLER: And you’re our age. You’re our age.
PHOEBE: Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
PETE: What like Pete Dakota?
PHOEBE: Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
JOEY: Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
CHANDLER: That’s not a state Joe.
JOEY: Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
PETE: I got to go, so ah, I’ll see you guys later.
ALL: Okay.
CHANDLER: You’re our age!
PETE: So ah, we on for tomorrow?
MONICA: Absolutely!
MONICA: Now get out of here you!!
MONICA: Okay, I’m running out of places I can touch him!
MONICA: Look, is there something wrong with me?
MONICA: I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future?
MONICA: Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on!
MONICA: I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?
ROSS AND JOEY: No.
PHOEBE: Okay, I’m gonna go get Frank.
JOEY: So, we’re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, “Hey, let’s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,” remember?
JOEY: And then, and then, you turn to me and say, “Nah, let’s just hang out at your place.” Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
PHOEBE: Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
RACHEL: You know what else I’m not gonna miss?
RACHEL: "I’m Monica.
RACHEL: I wash the toilet 17 times a day.
RACHEL: Even if people are on it!"
MONICA: "Hi I’m Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I’d better wash it and shrink it!"
RACHEL: "I’m Monica, I don’t get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
PHOEBE: Hey! I call her!
MONICA: "Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
RACHEL: "Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend!
RACHEL: So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
PHOEBE: Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
ROSS: Item J437-A, color: winterberry.
ROSS: Hi umm, listen come here, come in.
ROSS: I’m so-so sorry about yesterday.
ROSS: I-I’m really sorry.
ROSS: It’s just that I
MONA: Listen Ross, you don’t have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
ROSS: You do?
MONA: Yeah, you still have feelings for me.
MONA: And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you.
MONA: And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can’t.
MONA: It’s too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just… It just wasn’t meant to be.
ROSS: Oh God you’re right.
MONA: Ross, we…we have to be strong. Okay, I-I’m gonna go.  Can I? To remember you?
ROSS: No.
PHOEBE: I’m telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
ROSS: Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don’t want to make it savory.
MONICA: Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
ROSS: Gimme this.
RACHEL: Hi! Okay, don’t be mad at me, but I couldn’t resist.
MONICA: Brides magazines?
RACHEL: Yes, and I know that you’d say no if he asked you, but I’m sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
PHOEBE: Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.
MONICA: It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.
MONICA: I know it’s a little sudden, and it’s a little rushed, and it’s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn’t mean I can’t.
MONICA: Right?
MONICA: I mean I’m-I’m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
RACHEL: Oh my God.
MONICA: I know.  I need more pie.
PHOEBE: Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
RACHEL: You didn’t break up with that fireman?
PHOEBE: No, that was my way of telling you.
PHOEBE: Well, it turns out he’s incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints.
PHOEBE: He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
RACHEL: Wow!
PHOEBE: Yeah, well he’d prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
MONICA: So then, are you going to dump Jason?
PHOEBE: Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and… Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now so’s Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?
PHOEBE: So… It’s really just about the math.
MIKE: Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.
CHANDLER: Ok, look! Enough is enough!
MONICA: No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
CHANDLER: Monica, that was also true an
MONICA: I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
MONICA: You knew this about me when you married me!
MONICA: You agreed to take me in sickness and in health.
MONICA: Well, this is my sickness!
JOEY: Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
RACHEL: Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.
JOEY: Yeah me too, all night.
RACHEL: Really?! How come we didn’t cross paths?
JOEY: Yeah well that’s because uh…I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don’t want to look in my hamper.
CHANDLER: I can’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!
JOEY: Wait! Wait! Maybe she’s a hooker
PHOEBE: Yeah, okay let’s leave these two alone.
RACHEL: No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!
PHOEBE: Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
JULIE: So.
RACHEL: So.
RACHEL: I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit.
RACHEL: I mean, you know, we've never really talked.
RACHEL: I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
JULIE: I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
RACHEL: Really? Me?
JULIE: Oh my god, are you kidding?
JULIE: Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
RACHEL: Well, you're not totally paranoid.
JULIE: Oy.
RACHEL: Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
JULIE: Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
RACHEL: Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
JULIE: I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
RACHEL: All right, Julie.
JULIE: Bye.
RACHEL: Bye.  What a manipulative bitch.
PHOEBE: Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
CHANDLER: Oh, that’s uh, that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go with the one I picked first.
PHOEBE: Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It’s over!
CHANDLER: What?
PHOEBE: Some guy bought it. I’m sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!
CHANDLER: They put you in jail?
PHOEBE: The little jail between the doors!
CHANDLER: Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
PHOEBE: I know, I’m sorry! But y’know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
CHANDLER: Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
PHOEBE: Maybe it was the guy.
CHANDLER: It was the ring!
RACHEL: No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
BARRY: Well, if you want, I'll just—I'll just break it off with her.
RACHEL: No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
BERNICE: Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
BARRY: Thanks, Bernice.  Let's go away this weekend.
RACHEL: Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
BARRY: We can, we can go to Aruba!
BARRY: When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice.
BARRY: You would've liked it.
RACHEL: I had a bra.
BOBBY: Hey, Dr. Farber.
BARRY: All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
RACHEL: What?!
BOBBY: I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.
RACHEL: Oh my God! What does
MONICA: Oh that's an eye removal machine.
RACHEL: All right, I'm outta here!
MONICA: I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
RACHEL: So were done then!
DR. MILLER: Almost! But first, we gotta start.
DR. MILLER: This is a glaucoma test.
RACHEL: Uh-huh.
DR. MILLER: Sit down.
RACHEL: Okay.
DR. MILLER: But your chin here.  Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
RACHEL: What?!
MONICA: A small puff of air, now come on!
JOEY: Sure, now I’m scared.
PHOEBE: No, we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though, okay? ‘Cause I’m outta here sometime before Friday.
JOEY: Yeah, but I don’t wanna die!
PHOEBE: No-no, it’ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
PHOEBE: Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
CHANDLER: Oh, hey.
ROBERT: Hi.
PHOEBE: You’ve have lipstick right here . That’s okay, it’s mine, we just kissed.
CHANDLER: Hey!
JOEY: Hey!
JOEY: No. Y'know how we’re always saying we need a place for the mail.
JOEY: Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
CHANDLER: You’re building a post office?
JOEY: No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It’s a one day job, max.
CHANDLER: Okay.  My word! Those are snug.
JOEY: Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente’s.
JOEY: Power saw kinda got away from me there.
RACHEL: Hi!
CHANDLER: Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
RACHEL: So just bring it back downstairs, what’s the problem?
CHANDLER: I can’t seem to say goodbye.
RACHEL: Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
CHANDLER: Well I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
RACHEL: It was cheesecake.
RACHEL: It was fine.
RACHEL: It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling…  Wow!
RACHEL: My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
CHANDLER: Y’know what? Forget it!
RACHEL: Yeah and we’ll drop it off downstairs so that we’re not tempted.
CHANDLER: Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
RACHEL: Momma’s Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
TAG: This one’s from me.
RACHEL: Ahh!
TAG: It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun.
RACHEL: A scooter!
ROSS: Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
RACHEL: No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
CHANDLER: Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
RACHEL: Okay.
JOEY: Now that you’re a couple, we don’t get two presents from you guys?
CHANDLER: For my last birthday you gave me a
RACHEL: Okay.
RACHEL: Happy birthday Grandma!
RACHEL: It’s better to be over the hill  then buried under it.
RACHEL: All our love Monica and Chandler.
RACHEL: That’s funny, yeah!
CHANDLER: No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
RACHEL: No, I know! I get it! It’s funny!
CHANDLER: No, because you’re not a grandmother!
RACHEL: No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things.
RACHEL: That’s why it’s so funny.
MONICA: All you had to do was buy the card!
PHOEBE: Hey, Joey. What's going on?
JOEY: Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
MONICA: Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
JOEY: Sorry. Wrong boobies.
MONICA: Hello, Joey.
MR. TRIBBIANI: Oh! ...Hello, dear.
JOEY: Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
CHANDLER: I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
JOEY: Really?
CHANDLER: No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..
BOTH: Hey, buddy.
RECEPTIONIST: Oh, that's attractive.
CHANDLER: Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
ROSS: Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
JOEY: Oh, ah- the kid has it.
ROSS: The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
CHANDLER: You gotta do it, man.
ROSS: Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever——can't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.
ROSS: Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
RECEPTIONIST: Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
ROSS: GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
ROSS: ...Now
RACHEL: Oh, look, wish me luck!
MONICA: What for?
RACHEL: I'm gonna go get one of those  job things.
PHOEBE: Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That’s good right?
MONICA: You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
PHOEBE: What? He’s gonna be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green!
MONICA: Hi!
PHOEBE: I’m so glad you could make it.
MONICA: Yes, thank you so much. And again, we’re so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
MRS. GREEN: Try. There’s my little girl.
MONICA: She’s still mad.
PHOEBE: Yeah I know. Isn’t it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
MONICA: Phoebe, Sandra’s mad at you too. It-it doesn’t bother you?
RACHEL: Oh, that’s very—Really very-very okay.
MARC: Julie’s cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, that’s about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.
JULIE: Have you felt Rachel’s cervix Ross?
RACHEL: No, I don’t think we’ll be doing that.
ROSS: We’re not gonna do that.
JULIE: Well, if you like you can feel Rachel’s and then feel mine to compare.
MRS. GELLER: Am I interrupting?
ROSS: Uh yes! Thank you.
RACHEL: Oh. Oh wait no.
ROSS: Later.
ROSS: Oh uh, I’m sorry.
RACHEL: No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
MONICA: Try feeding her again.
RACHEL: I already fed her.
MONICA: I know, that’s why I said again!
PHOEBE: Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay?   That’s just what she wants.
CHANDLER: Hey.
MONICA: Phoebe! Rachel! It’s Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh.
RACHEL: Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
MONICA: For what?
RACHEL: Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
PHOEBE: And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
MONICA: You al-you already had it?
PHOEBE: Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
RACHEL: Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don’t have either.
PHOEBE: We ruined everything.
RACHEL: Ugh
MONICA: Well no, wait a minute, that’s not true!
MONICA: No, what did, that was really sweet.
MONICA: And it kinda works out for the best.
RACHEL: What do you, what do you mean?
MONICA: Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love!
MONICA: I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I don’t even like!
RACHEL: Surprise
JOEY: Surprise
RACHEL: Monica.
MONICA: I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
PHOEBE: Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off.
PHOEBE: Not you guys.
PHOEBE: You got it going on!
MONICA: So, what are we gonna do today?
MIKE: They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
MONICA: Ping pong?  Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
CHANDLER: I don't think so!
MONICA: Why not?
CHANDLER: Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
MONICA: I'm not always that bad!
CHANDLER: Oh,
MONICA: I punched you...?
CHANDLER: And...?
MONICA: ... Phoebe...?
PHOEBE: ... and...?
MONICA: I clunked your heads together!
ROSS: Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
MONICA: Oh, that’s okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
ROSS: Yeah.
PHOEBE: Hey!
MONICA: I tried to reach you at work. There’s....been a fire.
PHOEBE: What?! Oh my...  Oh my God!! What happened?!
ROSS: Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room.
PHOEBE: All right. Did everyone get out okay?
MONICA: Well, the giraffe’s okay. And so is the pirate.
PHOEBE: Ohh. What is this?
ROSS: No Phoebe, don’t look! You don’t want to see what’s under there!!
PHOEBE: Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
ROSS: Hey! How long until Pete’s fight?
MONICA: Oh, about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
ROSS: Hot dog?
MONICA: Four, please.  I’m really nervous.  Thank you.
PHOEBE: So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
ROSS: I gotta tell you, I-I wasn’t expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn’t expecting to like anyone right now, but she’s really terrific.
PHOEBE: Ohh, that’s too bad!
ROSS: No, I-I’m saying I liked her.
PHOEBE: Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
ROSS: Pheebs, I think she’s great. Okay? We’re going out again.
PHOEBE: Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
CHANDLER: Hey! Which one’s my turkey burger?
ROSS: Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
JOEY: Hey, the fight’s starting!
ROSS: Okay, we’ll be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
CHANDLER: Nine times!
CHANDLER: Okay, I had to put on lotion!
CHANDLER: But, it’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
JOEY: Fight’s over!
CHANDLER: Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married?
JOEY: Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before.
MONICA: Hi guys!
JOEY: Hey!
MONICA: What are you up too?
CHANDLER: Oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites.
CHANDLER: Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
JOEY: Yeah, Big Brother.
MONICA: Well that’s a little crazy. Although I am y’know glad to hear that you’re branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
CHANDLER: Yeah, well… Y’know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
MONICA: Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
CHANDLER: Eh
MONICA: Okay well that’s good to know.
JOEY: The Mr. Bowmont’s here!!!
CHANDLER: Oh that’s great, my friend Joey’s in the movie business.
DANA: Y’know who I ran into from school? Howie.
CHANDLER: My friend’s name is Joey.
DANA: Apparently Howie’s editing now.
DANA: Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.
DANA: Can you believe that?!
DANA: Y’know I-I-I haven’t spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
CHANDLER: Yeah, I’ve always hated that Howie.
DANA: No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
CHANDLER: The nerve huh?
DANA: Yeah!
CHANDLER: Refill?
ROSS: Hey! How you doing?
TAG: Good! Good, long time no see.
TAG: Like your sweater.
ROSS: Oh hey, right back at ya.
TAG: Oh, it’s crazy about Rachel huh?
ROSS: Yeah. She—Well, she’s one crazy lady?
TAG: So whose is it?
ROSS: Umm, I don’t some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.
TAG: Okay.
ROSS: He is so weird.
MONICA: You wanna fool around with Joey?
RACHEL: Yeah!
RACHEL: You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't    get it out of my head!
RACHEL: And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
MONICA: Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
RACHEL: Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
MONICA: Who, who are they?
RACHEL: I know them from work.
MONICA: Both of them?
RACHEL: No, one of them...
MONICA: Which one?
RACHEL: I don't know, what were the names I just said?
MONICA: Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
RACHEL: All right, all right, you're right
MONICA: What the hell are you cooking!
PHOEBE: Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
PHOEBE: Fire alarm?  Oh! Hi, officer—fireman, can-can I help you?
THE FIREMAN: We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
PHOEBE: That’s not mine.
THE FIREMAN: Yes it is.
PHOEBE: How do you know?
THE FIREMAN: The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don’t wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
PHOEBE: Okay do you—Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
THE FIREMAN: Please reattach this, it’s against the law to disconnect them.
PHOEBE: Fine!  But please God.. tell me how to stop them from going off!
THE FIREMAN: There’s a reset button under the plastic cover.
PHOEBE: There’s a reset button?!
PHOEBE: My God!
PHOEBE: Why didn’t I see that!
PHOEBE: Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button?
PHOEBE: Oh here it is!
PHOEBE: Oh!
PHOEBE: Ohh, God!
ROSS: Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
CHANDLER: Ring dammit, ring!
ROSS: Thanks.
JOEY: Hey, you know our phone's not working?
CHANDLER: What?!
JOEY: I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
CHANDLER: I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
MONICA: Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.
JOEY: Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
JOEY: Nngghhh!!!!!!!
JOEY: Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
ROSS: "Heating device."
PHOEBE: Radiator.
ROSS: Five letters.
PHOEBE: Rdtor.
JOEY: Yeah, is Sidney there?  Oh, this is?  Sidney's a woman.
RECEPTIONIST: Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
JOEY: Well, how long do you think it'll be?
RECEPTIONIST: Any minute now.
ROSS: Hey, this-  Heyy...
CHANDLER: Hey.
JOEY: Hey! Any good mail?
CHANDLER: Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor’s Guild.
JOEY: Ooh, it’s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I’m kinda….
CHANDLER: "Benefits lapsed."
JOEY: Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
CHANDLER: Okay, it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn’t work enough last year.
JOEY: Let me see that!
CHANDLER: All right.
JOEY: Oh, I can’t believe this!
JOEY: This sucks!
JOEY: When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know?
JOEY: And it wouldn’t matter.
JOEY: Now I gotta be careful?
CHANDLER: I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to  stop catching on fire.
JOEY: All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my agent.
CHANDLER: Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
JOEY: look both ways before you cross the street.
MONICA: I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
CHANDLER: I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
CHANDLER: I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
MONICA: Do you know anything about women?
CHANDLER: No.
MONICA: That's all right.
CHANDLER: Okay.
RACHEL: Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
ROSS: Yeah. He could row like a viking.
MONICA: Hi.
ALL: Mmm.
ROSS: So how'd it go?
MONICA: Oh, y'know..
PHOEBE: Did he mention us?
MONICA: He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
ROSS: You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
MONICA: ...love you.
ROSS: Are you're hands still wet?
JOEY: Uh, moist, yeah.
RACHEL: Let's dry 'em again.
RACHEL: Oh my God! Oh my God!!
MONICA: Still crying?
RACHEL: Like a
MONICA: Y’know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
RACHEL: What’s the other one?
MONICA: I don’t know, I’ve never had to use the other one.
MONICA: I’m just saying y’know, if we’re having sex, he’s not gonna be talking.
RACHEL: Oh that’s right.
RACHEL: You’re the talker.
RACHEL: Anyway uh, great idea!
RACHEL: Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
MONICA: Oh, we have some
RACHEL: No you don’t!
PHOEBE: Okay, yeah.  Triple A can pick us up.
PHOEBE: Yeah, what town are we near?
MONICA: Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
PHOEBE: Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we’re on?
RACHEL: Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
PHOEBE: Okay.  We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay.  There is no Route 27.   Okay, either 93 or 76?
RACHEL: I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
PHOEBE: Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?
PHOEBE: Okay!
PHOEBE: Yeah, no they don’t do that.
RACHEL: Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
MONICA: Who?
MONICA: I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half?
MONICA: I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
RACHEL: No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
PHOEBE: But if...
RACHEL: No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else.
PHOEBE: Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
MONICA: So the going for help went well?
JOEY: I’m telling you man, I saw it.
CHANDLER: Yeah, well, you’re wrong! Okay, you’re wrong.
JOEY: I’m not wrong! I wish I was. I’m sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn’t sound so bad now, huh?
MONICA: I know.
MONICA: Let’s try a look…of far off…wonderment.
MONICA: Okay, we’ll-we’ll gaze into our future and we’ll think about our marriage and the days to come.
MONICA: Chandler!
MONICA: What is the matter with your face?!
MONICA: I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!"
MONICA: Hey!
MONICA: Don’t laugh at him!
MONICA: He’s
RACHEL: We’re gonna find love!
PHOEBE: Definitely!
RACHEL: Yeah, I’m pretty confident about that.
RACHEL: That’s what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!
RACHEL: It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
PHOEBE: What do you mean?
RACHEL: Well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they’re 40, they marry each other.
PHOEBE: You mean a backup?
RACHEL: Exactly!
PHOEBE: Yeah, yeah I got that.
RACHEL: You do?
PHOEBE: Hm-mmm
RACHEL: Who?
PHOEBE: Yeah!
RACHEL: Are you serious?!
PHOEBE: Yeah, I locked him years ago!
RACHEL: Wh… So… If neither of you are married by the time you’re 40, you’re gonna marry Joey.
PHOEBE: Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
RACHEL: Oh, seriously?
JOEY: Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
CHANDLER: Yeah, I’m sorry man.  You wanna go watch?
JOEY: Yeah!
TAG: Good morning.
RACHEL: Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
TAG: Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
RACHEL: Ohh that’s nice.
TAG: Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
RACHEL: Wo-women? You mean like old women?
TAG: Well kinda old, like 30.
RACHEL: Oh.
TAG: And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
RACHEL: That’s great! Wow man, so Joey must’ve really taught you some stuff huh?
TAG: A little.
RACHEL: Yeah?
TAG: How you doin’?
MONICA: Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
PHOEBE: I know.
RACHEL: So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
MONICA: What did you just say?
CHANDLER: You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
MONICA: Are you serious?!
CHANDLER: Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
MONICA: I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
CHANDLER: Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it!
CHANDLER: What do you say?
MONICA: Okay!
CHANDLER: Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
CHANDLER: Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
DRUNKEN GAMBLER: It went under the table.
MONICA: Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
CHANDLER: Here it is! Here it is!
MONICA: That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
CHANDLER: It's a four.
MONICA: I think so too.
JOEY: Well that’s it. I’m done. Whew!  There come the meat sweats.
MONICA: Well Joey, we’re all…we’re all very proud of you.
CHANDLER: Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
PHOEBE: Is there anything we can do for you?
JOEY: No just, nobody press on my stomach.
RACHEL: You can keep those pants by the way.
JOEY: Whoa—hey—wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
MONICA: Yeah, you want some?
JOEY: Ah, just cut me a little sliver.
JOEY: A little bigger.
JOEY: Little bigger.
JOEY: What?!
JOEY: Are you afraid you’re gonna run out?!
JOEY: Cut me a real piece!
ROSS: Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
PHOEBE: I need to talk to you, it’s pretty urgent. It’s about Monica and Chandler.
ROSS: Oh my God!
ROSS: Of course, of course.
ROSS: Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment?
ROSS: Umm, do you know each other’s hometowns?
ROSS: Why don’t you…   Wh-what’s going on?
PHOEBE: Well, umm, not much.
PHOEBE: But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y’know?
PHOEBE: So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
ROSS: Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?
PHOEBE: Nothing..Why?
ROSS: Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
PHOEBE: Oh yeah it is! I’m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
ROSS: Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
PHOEBE: Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
ROSS: Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this.
ROSS: Okay,  I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine my life without you.
ROSS: Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart.
ROSS: Your good heart Rach,  and, and....
RACHEL: No.
RACHEL: I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me now.
RACHEL: I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever.
RACHEL: God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t,  it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross.
RACHEL: It’s just changed, everything.
RACHEL: Forever.
ROSS: Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean.
RACHEL: Then how come it is?
MONICA: Windows are clean, candels are lit.
MONICA: Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt.
MONICA: Did I turn the fish?
MONICA: No, cause I made lasagne.
MONICA: Am I out of control?
RACHEL: Just a touch.
RACHEL: Mon, I don't understand.
RACHEL: I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms?
RACHEL: I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
MONICA: What?
RACHEL: Could tonight be the Night?
MONICA: I don't know.
MONICA: Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know.
MONICA: Things happen, and they happen.
MONICA: You don't plan these things.
RACHEL: So, did you shave your legs?
MONICA: Yeah.
JOEY: Ross!
THE CASTING DIRECTOR: Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.
JOEY: Hi!
THE CASTING DIRECTOR: Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
JOEY: Uh-oh.
THE CASTING DIRECTOR: Is there a problem?
JOEY: Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato.
JOEY: But that's okay, no problem.
JOEY: No problem.
JOEY: Hmm, noodle soup.
THE CASTING DIRECTOR: Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
JOEY: Oh, what did I say?
THE CASTING DIRECTOR: Hmm, noodle soup.

ROSS: Yeah?
RACHEL: Give her some money.
ROSS: I really think they’re out of rooms.
RACHEL: They’re not!! Ross, they’re just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
ROSS: Well then we’d be in a lot of trouble, you don’t know where any countries are.
ROSS: Okay.
ROSS: Uh, say would you umm… Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up?
NURSE: This is a hospital.
RACHEL: Y’know what?
RACHEL: I’d have to say I really don’t care for your tone.
RACHEL: And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to—Whoa!
RACHEL: Oh gosh!
ROSS: What-what?
RACHEL: Ow! Ow! Contraction.  Ow-ow! Ow-ow!
NURSE: Would you like to see a semi-private room?
RACHEL: Yeah, it couldn’t hurt to look.
ROSS: I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
KRISTIN: That's funny. Who are they?
ROSS: The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
KRISTIN: You mean they're lovers.
ROSS: If you wanna put a label on it.
KRISTIN: Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
RACHEL: Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
ROSS: Okay, quick and painful.
RACHEL: Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
ROSS: Oh, what? What-what?
RACHEL: Y'know Marcel?
ROSS: ...Yeah?
RACHEL: Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
RACHEL: Hi Pheebs!
PHOEBE: Hi!
RACHEL: How are ya?
PHOEBE: Good.
RACHEL: Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy’s cell phone?
PHOEBE: Yeah.
RACHEL: And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
PHOEBE: Yeah!
RACHEL: And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
PHOEBE: Ooh, now you lost me.
RACHEL: You stole the phone!
PHOEBE: No I didn’t!
RACHEL: No? So you’re saying that if I called it, it wouldn’t ring?
PHOEBE: No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.  Oh, it does work!
RACHEL: Phoebe!
TAG: It’s not here.
RACHEL: Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don’t you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
TAG: How could I have left them in the copy room?
RACHEL: I don’t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It’s not a perfect world! Just go please.
TAG: Fine.
JOEY: How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
STAGE DIRECTOR: This will be your phone.
JOEY: That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
STAGE DIRECTOR: No you answer it and take pledges.
JOEY: But I'm the host!
STAGE DIRECTOR: No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
JOEY: You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
STAGE DIRECTOR: Well, here's your phone doctor.
GUNTHER: Hey guys.
MONICA: Hey Gunther. Hi.  I mean you’re going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
PHOEBE: Well, he’s very charming.
MONICA: I know, he’s too charming, but if you two start going out, then it’s just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
PHOEBE: Well, you’re just gonna have to try.
MONICA: Joey, where are the
JOEY: I don’t know, Chandler is supposed to be passin’ ‘em around...
CHANDLER: Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.
MONICA: Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
CHANDLER: Oh I’m sorry! Do you need a break?
MONICA: My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
CHANDLER: I can see it from right here. It’ll cost you one husband.
MONICA: Okay, I’m sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.
PHOEBE: Come on more!
MONICA: Oh God!
PHOEBE: Yeah, you like that don’t you?
MONICA: Oh yeah right there!
PHOEBE: You want it there? You take it there baby!
MONICA: Uh Phoebe?
PHOEBE: Yeah, say my name. Say it!  And now I’m going to cover you back up, and umm we’re never doing this again.
KATE: Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?
JOEY: Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be!
JOEY: Huh?
JOEY: Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out!
JOEY: I talk to you and it’s nothin’.
JOEY: You look at me, and nothin’.
JOEY: Nothing.
THE DIRECTOR: You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we’re gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
KATE: Well, that was ah...
MONICA: What?! What are you doing?!
CHANDLER: Do you know what just happened?
MONICA: Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
CHANDLER: No. We were in the middle of sex…and
MONICA: Nooo! No, that’s not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked my world!
JOEY: Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
PHOEBE: Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
ROSS: Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
PHOEBE: Oh, it's not!

JOEY: What the hell is in there?
PHOEBE: It's just my knitting that's all!  Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
JOEY: There will come a time in each of your careers when you’ll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor.
JOEY: I had such an opportunity in the recent, present.
JOEY: And I’m ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually.
JOEY: Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him.
JOEY: And now, he’s got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I’m stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV.
JOEY: I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.
JOEY: Thank you.

MONICA: And Monica knows...
ROSS: Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
MONICA: Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
JOEY: So what's it gonna be?
ROSS: Wait—oh—hey—huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
MONICA: I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
JOEY: Or an uncle...
CHANDLER: Hey Phoebe!
ROSS: Hi Pheebs!
RACHEL: Pheebs!

JOEY: Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
CHANDLER: More coffee over here, please!
PHOEBE: Hey.
JOEY: Hey. What, what are you doing here?
PHOEBE: Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental.
PHOEBE: Yeah,  oh, but oh...
JOEY: Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
PHOEBE: Destiny.
JOEY: Sure.
PHOEBE: Yes.
JOEY: All right.
PHOEBE: Okay.  Yikes! That one doesn’t look very fulfilled.
JOEY: Oh, that’s, that’s ah, one of the old ones, he’s just taking it to the back.
PHOEBE: You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
JOEY: Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
PHOEBE: So, what happens to the old guys?
JOEY: Well, they go into the chipper.
PHOEBE: Why, do I have a feeling that’s not as happy as it sounds?  No! Nooooo!!!
JOEY: Hey! Hey!!
MONICA: Light still out?
RACHEL: Yeah.
MONICA: Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
RACHEL: Oh please, they're having sex.
MONICA AND PHOEBE: Shut up!
RACHEL: So, whaddya think George is like?
MONICA: I think he's shy.
PHOEBE: Yeah?
MONICA: Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
ROSS: Hi! Hi, I’m Ross, you don’t know me, but I’m a big, big fan of yours. I mean,
ISABELLA: Aren’t you with that girl over there?
ROSS: Well, yeah, kinda.
ROSS: Um, but that’s okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so I’m allowed to sleep with you.
ROSS: No, no, no, it’s flattery.
ROSS: Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella.
ROSS: Don’t, don’t just dismiss this so fast.
ROSS: I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
ISABELLA: Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
ROSS: Um, yeah.
ISABELLA: May I see it?
ROSS: Um, no.
ISABELLA: Come on!
ROSS: But, okay.
ISABELLA: I’m not on the list!
ROSS: Um, see, but that’s not the final draft.
ISABELLA: It’s laminated!
ROSS: Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
ISABELLA: Y'know it’s ironic...
ISABELLA: ...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
ROSS: We’re just gonna be friends.
PHOEBE: Get out of here you lurker!  Go on! Get!
CHANDLER: Hey Pheebs!
PHOEBE: Ohh! You made up!
MONICA: Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
CHANDLER: Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.
PHOEBE: Ohh, get a room.
MONICA: We have one.
PHOEBE: I know. Use it.
RACHEL: Oh Mon, listen I have to ask!
RACHEL: Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
MONICA: Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
RACHEL: Ohh! And I’m one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
MONICA: Well, y’know it’s none of my business, but aren’t you married?
RACHEL: Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y’know I just wish we could be like on a break!
RACHEL: Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
ROSS: So that’s the only reason she could be here huh?
ROSS: It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a
RACHEL: Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
ROSS: I think I can take care of myself, I’ll talk to you later.
ROSS: Good-bye.
ROSS: Whoa!
ROSS: Uh, that was your sister actually.
ROSS: She-she thinks that you’re just using me.
JILL: So?
PHOEBE: I’m sorry.
PHOEBE SR: What are you doing here?!
PHOEBE: I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
PHOEBE SR: What?!
PHOEBE: Umm, okay, okay, look.
PHOEBE: I took this picture from your fridge.
PHOEBE: Okay, because I know that this is my Father.
PHOEBE: Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him.
PHOEBE: Now, look I deserve to know where I came from.
PHOEBE: All right?
PHOEBE: So if you can help me find my Father then you should!
PHOEBE: Otherwise, you’re just mean!
PHOEBE: So, just tell me the truth!
PHOEBE SR: All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
PHOEBE: My Father is Chuck Magioni?
PHOEBE SR: No, no, that’s just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year!
PHOEBE SR: And I’m very sorry, but I don’t know where your Father is, and that’s the truth.
PHOEBE: Oh.
PHOEBE SR: But umm, you’re right.
PHOEBE SR: I think that a person should know where they come from.
PHOEBE SR: Wh-which is why I ah,  ahh,  okay.
PHOEBE SR: I’m your mother.
PHOEBE: Heh?
PHOEBE SR: Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
A STUDENT: What’s happening to your accent?
ROSS: Come again?
ROSS: What’s-what’s this nonsense?
ROSS: All right, I’m-I’m not English.
ROSS: I’m from Long Island.
ROSS: I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out.
ROSS: I’m sorry.
ROSS: So, if we could just get back to the lecture.
ROSS: Umm, were there any questions?
ROSS: About paleontology.
ROSS: All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression.
ROSS: Obviously, I screwed up.
ROSS: But what you guys think of me is really important because I’m-I’m hoping to get a permanent job here.
ROSS: So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression
RACHEL: Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am
ROSS: Well, hello Rachel!
CHANDLER: Where you going, Joe?
JOEY: For a walk.
CHANDLER: Oh. You mind if I join you?
JOEY: Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts.
CHANDLER: Your thoughts? Plural?
JOEY: Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny,    I gotta see her!
CHANDLER: I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
JOEY: Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her??
JOEY: You guys are killing me!
JOEY: She's forbidden fruit!
JOEY: It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh?
JOEY: Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?
CHANDLER: Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
JOEY: Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against    the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
CHANDLER: Great novels?
JOEY: Fine ... mediocre porn
RACHEL: Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we’re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner’s office.
RACHEL: Now, he doesn’t get in until 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
TAG: That’s kinda sad.
RACHEL: Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her,
TAG: Got it!
RACHEL: Let’s roll!
MR. ZELNER: Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
RACHEL: Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything—minute. Okay. Fine.  Abort the plan, abort the plan.
MR. ZELNER: Uh actually, I’d like to speak with both of you.
RACHEL: Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
PHOEBE: Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
CASSIE: Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
PHOEBE: Oh! No problem! I
CASSIE: What?
HOSHI: You are iron.
HOSHI: You are steel!
HOSHI: Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
PETE: I told you, we’re adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
RACHEL: I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
MONICA: Look, you and I went to different high schools...
RACHEL: Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same high school.
MONICA: You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip’s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket.
MONICA: I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
RACHEL: They had to have that specially made?!
MONICA: It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
RACHEL: Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
MONICA: Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he’s-he’s called me up and asked me out.
MONICA: And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go.
MONICA: I-I owe her this.
MONICA: I never let her eat.
RACHEL: Oh, you go out with him.
MONICA: Oh, really?!
RACHEL: Yeah. Just, if it’s possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
MONICA: I’ll try.
JOEY: Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you’re dancing with.
JOEY: Yeah, yeah, okay.
JOEY: Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown – I’m trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
JOEY: Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she’s real, uh, mellow!
JOEY: Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know
RACHEL: Ross, get over it! It’s not like she hates you.
ROSS: Yeah but
RACHEL: Ross, she’s not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
ROSS: Huh. Y’know what’s not one of a kind? A twin!
RACHEL: Ooh, Phoebe’s here! Okay, let’s turn out all the lights and we’ll just watch the movie!
PHOEBE: Okay. Hey—Ooh, cool sheets!
ROSS: Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
PHOEBE: Sure!
RACHEL: He got it a flea market!
PHOEBE: You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
RACHEL: And Joey?
JOEY: How do you think she's doing?
RACHEL: Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
ROSS: Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
RACHEL: Thank you!
CHANDLER: Now that Rachel's gone?
RACHEL: So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
MONICA: Oh, god help us.
JOEY: What?
MONICA: Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
JOEY: Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
JOEY: I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
ROSS: So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
CAROL: Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
ROSS: Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
CAROL: What do you mean?
ROSS: Carol our sex life is—it’s just not working
ROSS: Hey there little fella!
ROSS: Hey, uh-hey, why don’t we get some shoes on ya, huh?
ROSS: Hey, why don’t you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room!
ROSS: Yay!
BEN: Yay!
ROSS: Yay!
ROSS: Seriously, our sex life… I was thinking, maybe I don’t know, we could try some-some new things.
ROSS: For fun?
CAROL: Like what?
ROSS: Well I don’t know umm,  what if we were too tie each other up?
ROSS: Umm, some people eat stuff off one another.
ROSS: Nah!
ROSS: Umm, y’know we-we could try dirty talk?
ROSS: Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
CAROL: I love that idea!
RACHEL: So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
MONICA: Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
PHOEBE: Oh my God, they took my idea!
MONICA: That was you?!
PHOEBE: Yeah! Okay, here you go.
GUNTHER: Rachel, I made you a cocoa.
PHOEBE: Oh my God, are you guys okay?
GUNTHER: Are you all right?
JOEY: Oh my.
RACHEL: Sit!
JOSHUA: Hi.
RACHEL: Oh my gosh, Joshua!
JOSHUA: All those things I said about not being ready
RACHEL: They’re not true?
JOSHUA: No, they’re-they’re all true.
RACHEL: Oh.
JOSHUA: But
RACHEL: Oh! Oh, I love that but.
RACHEL: You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
JOSHUA: Yeah.
RACHEL: Okay.  Every time.
MONICA: What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
PHOEBE: Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
MONICA: Why would we do that?
PHOEBE: Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
MONICA: Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
RACHEL: Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
CHANDLER: The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
JOEY: The balloon?
CHANDLER: No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached
RACHEL: I can't, I gotta go.
CHANDLER: Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
PHOEBE: Almost never.
MONICA: Got the keys?
RACHEL: Ok.
MONICA: What d'you think?
JOEY: Lot of things.
RACHEL: Which one do you think she is?
TEACHER: May I help you?
MONICA: Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
TEACHER: You don't observe a dance class. You
RACHEL: What does she mean?
PHOEBE: I think she means  'You
MONICA: Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
TEACHER: People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
RACHEL: She could be you.
TEACHER: Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...
MONICA: Okay, I'm not getting this!
PHOEBE: I'm totally getting it!
MONICA: Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
RACHEL: What? You just click when they click.
TEACHER: Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
PHOEBE: Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
MONICA: Great. It's gym class all over again.
RACHEL: I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
BARRY: Nooo, it wasn't.
RACHEL: Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
CHANDLER: Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.
MONICA: I know
RACHEL: Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
CHANDLER: I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
MONICA: The sun is out!
CHANDLER: Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
MONICA: Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
CHANDLER: Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
ROSS: Walls are pretty thin, guys!
JOEY: Hi uh, I’m Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I’d like to donate some fluids.
RECEPTIONIST: We’re actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we’re not looking for applicants right now.
JOEY: Oh that’s too bad. I’ve kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure there’s no studies I can participate in?
RECEPTIONIST: Well, here’s a schedule of what’s coming up.
JOEY: Thanks.  Well but this one starts now.
RECEPTIONIST: Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It’s a twins study.
JOEY: But it’s $2,000.
RECEPTIONIST: Sorry.
JOEY: Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
RECEPTIONIST: We already got the results back on that on, and they’re not good.
MONICA: Hey! How’s it goin’?
PHOEBE: Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
MONICA: Yes it has! I made cookies!
PHOEBE: Oh that’s all right. I’m still full from your homemade potato chips.
MONICA: But you should eat them now because they’re hot from the oven.
PHOEBE: Okay.
MONICA: Oh-ho! But not in here! Can’t eat ‘em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
PHOEBE: Okay, I’ll be out in a second.
MONICA: Okay!
MONICA: What are you doing?
PHOEBE: That doesn’t lock does it?
MONICA: You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
JULIE: That saves us a conversation.
CHANDLER: Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
JOEY: Me too, we should get goin'.
STEPHANIE: No.
MONICA: Okay, here comes another camera.
ROSS: Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
ROSS: Why do they keep doing that?
MONICA: If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms.
MONICA: They’ve been taping those people up there all day.
ROSS: Right.
ROSS: Hey, what’d you guys do to get up on there?
MONICA: Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
ROSS: Yeah!
JANINE: Hey! You’re a good dancer!
JOEY: Really?
JANINE: Yeah, well you’d be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
JOEY: What do you mean?
JANINE: Like this.
JANINE: That’s it, feel the rhythm. That’s better.
JOEY: Uh-huh.
DIRECTOR: Okay, you’re dancing with that girl over there.
JOEY: No-no-no-no-no we came together!
DIRECTOR: I don’t see it.  You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!
JOEY: No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
DIRECTOR: Really, y’think so? I don’t..
RACHEL: Why aren’t you home yet?!
MONICA: Is someone there?
RACHEL: Oh yes, it’s me! Sorry!
CHANDLER: What are you doing here?
RACHEL: Uh, I’m just, I’m just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
CHANDLER: We got some
RACHEL: Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
MONICA: Who?  Is that your sister?
RACHEL: Ugh, she
MONICA: God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
RACHEL: Oh my God, look-look he’s taking off her clothes!
CHANDLER: He’s taking off her coat!
RACHEL: Oh, this is just terrible.
ELIZABETH: Ross! Wait!
ROSS: Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about
ELIZABETH: You suck!!
ROSS: What?!
ROSS: Okay, break-up’s still on!
JOEY: Hey.
ROSS: Hey.
JOEY: Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
ROSS: No, I don’t want to hit you.
JOEY: Oh what then? Kick me?
ROSS: No.
ROSS: My son? Pretty serious.  Oh hey Katie!  What uh, what are you doing here?
KATIE: Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this.
ROSS: Ah, must’ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
KATIE: Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description.
ROSS: Oh.
KATIE: Oh uh…I actually came here to ask you out.
ROSS: Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I’m just gonna put this  back in my pocket, pretend
KATIE: Sure!
RACHEL: Horny bitch.  No! You’re a horny bitch! Noooo! You’re the horny bitch! No! You’re a horny bitch!
RACHEL: Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
CHANDLER: Well, like father, like son.
RACHEL: Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
CHANDLER: Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
RACHEL: Well, y'know, possibly.  You didn’t tell him that, though? Right?
CHANDLER: Ummmmmmmm, no.
RACHEL: You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell the guy that!
RACHEL: Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date—oh, he’s so gonna get the wrong idea.
CHANDLER: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
ALL: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
CHANDLER: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
JOEY: Instead of...?
CHANDLER: That's right.
JOEY: Never had that dream.
PHOEBE: No.
CHANDLER: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
MONICA: Honey! Dinner’s ready!
JOEY: What’s my little chef got for me tonight?
MONICA: Your favorite!
JOEY: Ho-ho-ho,  fried stuff with cheese!
MONICA: Yep! And lot’s of it!
JOEY: Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here.  Okay.
MONICA: Okay, in we go.
JOEY: Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!  How you doin’?
MONICA: Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate.
MONICA: So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is.
MONICA: Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
MONICA: Oh my god.
JOEY: What?
MONICA: Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
JOEY: Come on, they're close.
MONICA: Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
JOEY: Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
MONICA: Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's—not really true, is it?
JOEY: Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
MONICA: Oh my god, what were you thinking?
JOEY: All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
MONICA: Oh!
JOEY: Ow!
MONICA: I'm outta here.
JOEY: Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
MONICA: Really?
JOEY: Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
CHANDLER: Hello! One marriage please!
MONICA: Yep, we wanna get married!
MONICA: All right.
CHANDLER: Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
MONICA: What are you doing?
CHANDLER: Oh, that's
MONICA: No, only because that's the graduation song.
CHANDLER: Okay!  This is it!  We're gonna get married!
MONICA: Are you sure you wanna do this?
ROSS: Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
RACHEL: Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!
RACHEL: Wait!  Okay!
MONICA: Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
RACHEL: It depends on who asked.
MONICA: What if I asked?
RACHEL: Oh, Mon, sure.
MONICA: Really?
RACHEL: Yes.  You’re not asking are you?
MONICA: No.
RACHEL: Yes! Totally!
KATHY: Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
RACHEL: You…are…not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
MONICA: He asked you out?!
RACHEL: No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
MONICA: Saucy!
RACHEL: What are these?
MONICA: Electrical plans for the building.
RACHEL: Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
MONICA: I know that switch does something, okay?
MONICA: So-so I went down to city hall and got these.
MONICA: All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
RACHEL: Wow! If only more people knew.
JANICE: Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in
RACHEL: Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
JANICE: So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.
PHOEBE: Oh, nobody's judging you.
JANICE: Oh! Okay!  You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me!
ROSS: Oh man!
ROSS: I want that place so much!!
ROSS: I was so sure that was gonna work!
ROSS: There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
RACHEL: All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
MONICA: Bye!
ALL: Bye!
PHOEBE: Bye Chandler!   I miss you already.
CHANDLER: Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
MONICA: Actually, I did!
CHANDLER: Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
MONICA: Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
CHANDLER: Are you serious?
MONICA: Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
CHANDLER: Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps—She knows!
ELIZABETH: Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
ROSS: All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
ELIZABETH: No, let's just leave the lights on.
ELIZABETH: Oh my God!
MONICA: You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
ROSS: Oh fine.
MONICA: Ready?  Wrestle!
RACHEL: Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
JOEY: All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
ROSS: Can we please focus here, a naked man’s life hangs in the balance!
PHOEBE: I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
JOEY: All right, ladies and gentlemen, let’s poke.
JOEY: Steady.
JOEY: Steady.
JOEY: Okay, a little higher.
JOEY: Careful of the angle.
JOEY: Okay, okay, we’re approaching the window  Thread the needle.
JOEY: Thread the needle.
PHOEBE: He’s alive! He’s a-live!!!
MONICA: And yet, we’re still poking him.
JOEY: Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
ROSS: He does not look happy.
RACHEL: Hey-hey, now he’s showing us his poking device.
JOEY: Hey, that’s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
RACHEL: Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other.
RACHEL: Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard.
RACHEL: Oh God oh!
RACHEL: Contraction!
EVIL BITCH: Are you looking at her?!
SICK BASTARD: No!
EVIL BITCH: Don’t you look at her you sick bastard!
SICK BASTARD: Honey I swear! I wasn’t looking at her!
EVIL BITCH: She’s in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!
ROSS: Umm. Umm, I’m-I’m just gonna—
EVIL BITCH: See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert!
ROSS: No-no, I’m…I’m sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy.
EVIL BITCH: You miss your girlfriend?
ROSS: Just ignore them.
RACHEL: Ross.
ROSS: What? What?
RACHEL: He’s looking at me.
ROSS: Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!
EVIL BITCH: Don’t you talk to my husband like that you stupid bastard!

RACHEL: Yep!
PHOEBE: Alex Trebek?
RACHEL: Oh, of course!
PHOEBE: Chuck Woolery?
RACHEL: Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who’s ass I cannot kick.
RACHEL: Say it!
PHOEBE: Say we are unagi!
ROSS: It’s not something you are! It’s something you have!
RACHEL: Say it!
ROSS: Y’know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
MONICA: Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
RACHEL: Yeah, it's in there.
JOEY: Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
CHANDLER: Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
JOEY: Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
JOEY: oooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh
CHANDLER: Yes. Yes.
JOEY: You?!  And-and you?!
MONICA: Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
JOEY: How?! When?!
CHANDLER: It happened in London.
JOEY: IN LONDON!!!
CHANDLER: The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
JOEY: But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
CHANDLER: No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
MONICA: Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
JOEY: All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's
MONICA: I know, it's great!
JOEY: Aww, I don't want to see that!
PHOEBE: We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
JULIE: And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
RACHEL: Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?
JULIE: No Cobb, as in cobb salad.
RACHEL: Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
CHANDLER: What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
JOEY: Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
CHANDLER: Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
JOEY: You got a better idea?
CHANDLER: All right, call it in the air.
JOEY: Heads.
CHANDLER: Heads it is.
JOEY: Yes! Whew!
CHANDLER: We have to assign heads to something.
JOEY: Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
CHANDLER: What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
JOEY: Okay, some tricks of the trade.
JOEY: Now, I’ve never been able to cry as an actor, so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling.
JOEY: Or ah, or, let’s say I wanna convey that I’ve just done something evil.
JOEY: That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it’  Okay, let’s say I’ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13.
JOEY: And that’s how it’s done.
JOEY: Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
STUDENT: Hey, Mr. Trib.
JOEY: Hey-hey.
PHOEBE: Then I’m gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
MR. HECKLES: Who are you?
ERIC: Hi, I’m Eric, I’m gonna be Chandler’s new roommate.
MR. HECKLES: I’m Chandler’s new roommate.
ERIC: I-I-I don’t think so.
MR. HECKLES: I could be Chandler’s new roommate.
ERIC: But, he told me over the phone.
MR. HECKLES: He told me in person.
ERIC: That’s weird.
MR. HECKLES: Well, I’m going to go into my new apartment now.  Ehh!
PHOEBE: Hey! Look who I found!
CHANDLER: Oh, hey guys!
PHOEBE: Y’know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
CHANDLER: Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
PHOEBE: Or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas?
PHOEBE: Didn’t think so!
PHOEBE: Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!
CHANDLER: Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?
PHOEBE: Hmm, how about my azzz?
RACHEL: Hey, this is hollow.
PHOEBE: What?
RACHEL: This bench, it’s hollow! I can’t believe I never knew that!  Oh, the presents!!!
PHOEBE: No, don’t look directly at them!
CHANDLER: What?
PHOEBE: Alright, no, we could look at them!
MONICA: I
ROSS: Hi! I’m so glad you’re here, but it’s gonna be a while. I-I wished you’d called first.
MRS. GELLER: Oh that’s all right, I’m coming back later with your father.
ROSS: Oh good.
MRS. GELLER: I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.
ROSS: Okay, what’s up?
MRS. GELLER: I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it.
ROSS: Ma, you’re asking me to marry you?
MRS. GELLER: This is your grandmother’s engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
ROSS: Mom no, come on! Thank you.
MRS. GELLER: Just hear me out!
ROSS: Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or I’d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus.
ROSS: I can’t believe this!
PHOEBE: I know no, no, y'know you don’t deserve this, you don’t Ross.
PHOEBE: You’re, you’re really, you’re so good.
ROSS: Thanks.
PHOEBE: And you’re so sweet.  And you’re kind
ROSS: Thanks.
ROSS: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
PHOEBE: Okay, it’s okay.
ROSS: Wait, wait, wait.
ROSS: My foot is stuck in the pocket.
PHOEBE: What?
ROSS: No, I can’t get it out.
MARK: Rachel?
RACHEL: Yeah.  Hi Mark!
MARK: Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job.
RACHEL: Oh, I did!
MARK: Yes.

MONICA: Oh, stop beating yourself up!

MONICA: I
EARL: Philadelphia.
PHOEBE: Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I’ve got-I’ve got goose bumps.
EARL: Really?
PHOEBE: Well, y’know I’m wearing layers and it’s warm.
JOEY: Yeah.
PHOEBE: But if—no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
EARL: Did you hear that?!
EARL: I don’t need you guys to care about me!
EARL: Because the universe cares!
EARL: The whole universe!
EARL: I really wished they’d care just a little bit though.
ROSS: I like this one.  It seems to say, "I love you and that’s why I have to kill you."
MONICA: They can’t all be bad.  Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
CHANDLER: Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
MONICA: Do you really want to pull at that thread?
PHOEBE: I’m having a really good time!
KYLE: Me too! I’m sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.
PHOEBE: Ohh. No that’s okay, he’s a friend.
KYLE: Hey uh, I don’t mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
PHOEBE: Yeah, I… Well y’know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I’d just be lost.
KYLE: I know it’s really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss and—Oh no! No! No! My God!
PHOEBE: Okay, don’t freak out. I’ll go.
KYLE: No it’s… Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!
PHOEBE: Okay, I know. Hold on.  Hey Ross?
ROSS: Yeah?
PHOEBE: Yeah, umm that’s Whitney , Kyle’s ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y’know divert her so that we can slip out?
ROSS: What?! No!
PHOEBE: Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
ROSS: Look, I don’t think so Pheebs.  All right, I’ll do it. But just because you’re a friend.
CHANDLER: Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
ROSS: I'll take sports.
JOEY: Mine!
ROSS: All right. Uhh, international.
ROSS: Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say
PHOEBE: You two will have very hairy children.
ROSS: Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
RACHEL: Ross! Janice?!
JOEY: All right, hold on!
JOEY: Hold on.
JOEY: Hold on.
JOEY: This is Ross, okay?
JOEY: He's our friend.
JOEY: He obviously went crazy.
JOEY: He obviously lost his mind.
PHOEBE: So are you actually gonna see her again?
JOEY: Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
JOEY: Damnit Phoebe!!
ROSS: Hey, don’t we have to...
CHANDLER: Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
PHOEBE: Umm, I think you’re really, really great...
ROBERT: Oh God!
ROBERT: Here we go again.
ROBERT: Why does this keep happening to me?
ROBERT: Is it something I’m putting out there?
ROBERT: Is this my fault?
ROBERT: Or am I just nuts?
PHOEBE: I-I-I-I-I don’t know, I don’t know what to say.
GUNTHER: Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.
JOEY: Wait!
JOEY: Terry!
JOEY: Please!
JOEY: Look, I just lost my other job.
JOEY: Okay?
JOEY: You have no idea how much I need this.
JOEY: Please, help me out, for old times sake.
NURSE #1: This poor guy’s been in a coma for five years. It’s hopeless.
NURSE #2: It’s not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Ramoray’s a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.
DR. STRYKER RAMORAY: Good morning.  Drake, it’s your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
JOEY: I’m back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
MONICA: That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
CHANDLER: Well you did pull his hair.
MONICA: He took my snack!
CHANDLER: I’m not getting into this again!
MONICA: Okay! Oh God, y’know what? It’s really bad.
CHANDLER: Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay.
MONICA: This doesn’t mean anything, does it?
JOEY: Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car! Right?
CHANDLER: That is true.
PHOEBE: Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
JOEY: Oh, I’ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
MONICA: Joey, you know you don’t actually have one.
JOEY: Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her!
CHANDLER: Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.
MONICA: All right, that’s it, we’re going to the emergency room.
PHOEBE: What?! No, you can’t, you can’t leave me here with them! We’re baby-sitting!
MONICA: The babies are asleep, I’m sure you’ll be okay on your own for a while!
PHOEBE: But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!
MONICA: He’s got something plastic lodged in his throat, we’ve got to go to the hospital.
PHOEBE: But no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
CHANDLER: I think that’s gum.
PHOEBE: I’m pretty sure it’s gun.
CHANDLER: Okay, listen this really hurts. Let’s go.
PHOEBE: A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do?
ROSS: That was the only way I could get him to
JOEY: Hi! How are the Gellers?
RACHEL: Don’t call us that!
ROSS: The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
JOEY: Hey! It’s Porsche!!
MONICA: Hey sweetie!
CHANDLER: Hey!
CHANDLER: There’s no back to this couch!
MONICA: Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
CHANDLER: Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y’know?
CHANDLER: Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know, all dead inside.
MONICA: Oh that’s so sweet! Look Chandler I don’t care if you can’t cry, I love you.
CHANDLER: Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
MONICA: Stop it!
CHANDLER: No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we’re up at the altar and I’m like this.
MONICA: I won’t care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
CHANDLER: Yeah?
ROSS: Of course he is!
ROSS: What, do you think I’d just use my son as-as an excuse?
ROSS: What kind of father do you think I am?
MONICA: All right, sorry.
ROSS: I gotta go make a fake Ben.
MONICA: The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
CHANDLER: Well, either that or uh
MONICA: Joey!!
JOEY: Yeah?
MONICA: Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
JOEY: Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
PHOEBE: Yeah, and they’ve been coming by all day. They love it!
MONICA: They love my candy? Oh man!!! I’ve gotta go make more!!
JOEY: Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might’ve happened to a huge chunk of it.
MONICA: Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
ROSS: Mine stole my newspaper! It’s like a
PHOEBE: Sure!
ROSS: Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn’t stop thinking about it.
ROSS: I mean, everyone should have a-a
PHOEBE: Oh my God Ross!!
ROSS: You like it?
PHOEBE: I
ROSS: Yeah?
HELENA: Hello darlings.
CHANDLER: And there’s daddy!
PHOEBE: There he is! There he is!
MONICA: Where?
PHOEBE: Right- where we've been looking all night!
RACHEL: He is so cute!
MONICA: Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
ALL: Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the——wowww.
MONICA: I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
ANGELA: Yeah, isn't he?
MONICA: It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
ANGELA: You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
MONICA: Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
ANGELA: Huh. That's nice.
ROSS: and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’ve just lasted just one day, burned for
BEN: Eight whole days.
ROSS: That’s right, and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
BEN: Awesome!
ROSS: Yeah?
CHANDLER: My favorite part was when
ROSS: The Armadillo was actually not so
RACHEL: Hey!
PHOEBE: Oh.
RACHEL: Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny’s funeral in here.
ROSS: Come on, come on, we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!
RACHEL: Oh.
PHOEBE: Oh.
PHOEBE: Okay, I understand why
PETE: Yeah, sure. Good luck!
MONICA: I’m quitting!! Woo-hoo!  I’m okay!! I’m all right!!
PHOEBE: Wow! That’s exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
PETE: What?
PHOEBE: I’m just saying, this woman, I mean she’s fictitious. No?
PETE: Why would you say that?
PHOEBE: ‘Cause you’re still into Monica.
PHOEBE: So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ‘cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
PETE: You’re good. You’re good!
PHOEBE: Yeah, no, I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial gift.
PETE: Listen, can you promise me that you won’t tell her though?
PHOEBE: Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
PETE: Thanks a lot.
PHOEBE: No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive, but my memory sucks.
RACHEL: Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
MAN: For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
ROSS: Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
JULIE: Oh, thanks, sweetie.
ROSS: No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
JULIE: Really?
JULIE: You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
ROSS: No, no, they will. I just... uh...
JULIE: Can't wait.
MONICA: Do I know you?
MONICA: Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
STEVE: Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
MONICA: You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
STEVE: Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
MONICA: Uh, wait, backstage?
STEVE: Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.
ROSS: Ross.
CHANDLER: Chandler.
STEVE: Look, you guys wanna meet the group?
STEVE: Come on.
STEVE: So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?
JOEY: Do you have any respect for your body?
ROSS: Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
CHANDLER: Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease.
CHANDLER: The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
RACHEL: Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
CHANDLER: Really?
CHANDLER: He does?
CHANDLER: Hey, buddy, what's up!
CHANDLER: Oh, she told you about that, huh.
CHANDLER: Well, yeah, I have one now and then.
CHANDLER: Well, yeah, now.
CHANDLER: Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before.
CHANDLER: Well, okay, thanks!
RACHEL: God, he's good.
ROSS: If only he were a woman.
RACHEL: Yeah.
PHOEBE: Oh, look look look.
PHOEBE: The last candle's about to burn out.
PHOEBE: 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....
ROSS: Thank you.
PHOEBE: Thanks.
ROSS: Kinda... spooky without any lights.
JOEY: Bwah-hah-hah!
ROSS: OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
ROSS: Oh.. oh... oh.
JOEY: Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
RACHEL: All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
CHARLIE: You blew them away!
ROSS: Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face!
ROSS: I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?
CHARLIE: I was
ROSS: No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
CHARLIE: Oh my God!  I'm your
ROSS: I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
ROSS: Look, I took it too far!
ROSS: Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
MONICA: Could've played
CHANDLER: Thanks.
ROSS: Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.
CHANDLER: Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the
RACHEL: Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
CHANDLER: Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel.
RACHEL: Nooo!
RACHEL: Hello?
RACHEL: Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much.
RACHEL: Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
ROSS: Green. To the green.
RACHEL: I've got magic beans.  Never-never mind.
CHANDLER: To the left, to the left- aww!
RACHEL: Ohhh... I'm fine.
JOEY: Hey!
CHANDLER: Please tell me you got the message!
JOEY: What message?
CHANDLER: The actor playing Mac couldn’t do it, they needed to see you at 2 o’clock.
JOEY: What?! It’s 6 o’clock!
CHANDLER: Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board!
CHANDLER: I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya!
CHANDLER: I went to Ross’s!
CHANDLER: I went to the coffeehouse!
CHANDLER: I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
ROSS: That’s the day you’re gonna die? See—darnit, I’ve got shuffleboard that day.
PHOEBE: That’s what you think.
MONICA: Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother’s? Wouldn’t they have the recipe?
PHOEBE: Well, y’know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
MONICA: What was her name?
PHOEBE: Nestley Toulouse.
MONICA: Nestlé Toll House?
PHOEBE: Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
PHOEBE: Yes!!  Oh.
MONICA: I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
PHOEBE: I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  you’re burning in hell!!
KIM: So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
NANCY: Absolutely!
RACHEL: I am so on board!
KIM: Rachel didn't you just light that?
RACHEL: Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach.
NANCY: I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
KIM: Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like
NANCY: Tell me about it!
RACHEL: Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
KIM: It does sound appealing.
NANCY: Oh, I never could do it.
RACHEL: Oh but you could.
RACHEL: You can.
RACHEL: Absolutely!
RACHEL: We can help each other out!
RACHEL: We can get--what are those--those patches!
RACHEL: We could be like the Patch Sisters!
KIM: Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
RACHEL: Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
KIM: My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.
RACHEL: Okay then!
CHANDLER: Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
PHOEBE: Does, um, anyone wanna see?
ALL: Nooo..
ALL: Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
RACHEL: It's worse than the thumb!
CHANDLER: Hey, this is so unfair!
MONICA: Oh, why is it unfair?
CHANDLER: So I have a flaw!
CHANDLER: Big deal!
CHANDLER: Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?
CHANDLER: And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?
CHANDLER: And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?
CHANDLER: I mean, what the hell is that thing?
CHANDLER: ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
JOEY: ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
RACHEL: Well, I-I could live without it.
JOEY: Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
ROSS: Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
JOEY: Oh,  "you do, do you"?
ROSS: You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
RACHEL: "Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
PHOEBE: Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
RACHEL: Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
JOEY: Awww! Mel Torme died.
MONICA: Joey, that paper’s like a year old!
JOEY: Aw! Does that mean the
ROSS: Hey.
JOEY: Hey.
PHOEBE: You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
MONICA: Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
PHOEBE: Probably?
PHOEBE: Yeah, I don't like that word.
PHOEBE: Kind of what ‘probably’ really means.
PHOEBE: Yeah, uh-huh.
PHOEBE: Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," y’know?
PHOEBE: I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!"
PHOEBE: You gotta take care of yourselves!
PHOEBE: In
CHANDLER: Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
JANICE: Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.
RACHEL: Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn’t he?
JANICE: He’s a keeper. How are you feeling?
RACHEL: Oh, I’m fine.
JANICE: Can I just say, I really admire what you’re doing. Just raising her all alone.
RACHEL: Oh, I’m not doing it alone. I have Ross.
JANICE: Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
RACHEL: Well then he gets a divorce, it’s Ross!
JANICE: I’m telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they’re gonna be there until they start their real family.
RACHEL: Well I—That’s never gonna happen with Ross.
JANICE: Oh well that’s what I thought about my first husband, now I’m lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.
PHOEBE: And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.
ROSS: Hey. Who’s that?
RACHEL: New people.
ROSS: What happened to the Disgustingtons?
RACHEL: They’re having their baby!
RACHEL: It’s not fair Ross we got here first!
RACHEL: Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery.
RACHEL: Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
ROSS: Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
RACHEL: Phoebe?
PHOEBE: Yeah?
RACHEL: Look at that guy by the window, wow!
PHOEBE: He’s awfully short and I think he’s talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he’s not that good in bed.
RACHEL: Oh, what is wrong with me lately?
RACHEL: I mean it’s like every guy I see—I mean look here.
RACHEL: Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that’s not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I’m feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
PHOEBE: Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
RACHEL: Yeah.
PHOEBE: This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
RACHEL: Really?! So this has happened to you?
PHOEBE: Oh absolutely yeah!
PHOEBE: Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y’know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
RACHEL: Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa’s lap.
PHOEBE: Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a
JOEY: Ugh!
JOEY: I don’t know what I’m going to do!
JOEY: I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care!
JOEY: Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?
ROSS: Hey guys!
CHANDLER: Hey!
JOEY: Hey
ROSS: I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!
ROSS: And the guys from work had a blast.
ROSS: Y’know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.
ROSS: Yeah!
ROSS: And-and another one had never been to a party before, so
JOEY: So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that’s nice!
ROSS: Yeah, right!
JOEY: I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those
ROSS: That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
CHANDLER: So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
ROSS: Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
CHANDLER: So you might say, it’s a magic ring.
ROSS: OH MY GOD!! I didn’t really believe it until you just said it!!
ROSS: Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
JOEY: Obviously! So, how do we decide?
ROSS: Well now let’s-let’s look at this objectively, I think I should date her
JOEY: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
ROSS: That’s interesting, but check this out. I date her
JOEY: Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction
ROSS: Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
JOEY: Yeah well we should order some food then.
ROSS: No Joey! Look why don’t, why don’t we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we’ll
JOEY: That sounds fair.
ROSS: Maybe I’ll take her to that new French restaurant down the street
JOEY: Ah yeah—wait a second now!
JOEY: Look we’re gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.
JOEY: I don’t have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
ROSS: Well sorry, that’s what I do on dates.
JOEY: All right, well I guess I’ll just have to do what I do on dates.
ROSS: So let’s decide on the spending limit
JOEY: Yeah. Uh, …a slice……six dollars?
ROSS: I was thinking more like a hundred.
JOEY: Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
MONICA: Hi, again.
JOEY: Hey!
CHANDLER: Hey!
MONICA: Thank you soo, much.
CHANDLER: Oh, don’t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
MONICA: You want some help with that?
JOEY: Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I don’t!
MONICA: Whoa! Are you okay?
JOEY: Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
MONICA: It’s the heat.  And-and the humidity.
JOEY: That’s a uh, that’s a tough combination.
MONICA: Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
JOEY: Like you wouldn’t believe.  Wow! This is a great place.
MONICA: What do you mean?
PHOEBE: Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
JOEY: Oh!
JOEY: Hey, somebody left their keys.
JOEY: Ooohh, to a Porsche!
JOEY: Hey Gunther, these yours?
GUNTHER: Yeah, that’s what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
JOEY: Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?
MONICA: Joey, why don’t you put them in the lost and found?
JOEY: There’s a lost and found?  My shoe!
CHANDLER: You left a shoe here?!
JOEY: Well, I didn’t realize until I got home.
JOEY: I wasn’t gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!
JOEY: I’m gonna go find that guy’s car and leave a note on the windshield.
CHANDLER: Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I’ll be sure to give him your shoe.
JOEY: Great! Thanks.
CAROL: Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
ROSS: Carol, we've been through this before, ok?
ROSS: We have a good time.
ROSS: We laugh, we play.
ROSS: It's like we're father and son.
SUSAN: Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
RACHEL: Oh, this is so cute.
SUSAN: Oh, I got that for him.
ROSS: My mommies love me. That's clever.
MONICA: Hello?
MONICA: Oh, Hi, Ju——Hi, Jew!
MONICA: Uh huh?
MONICA: Uh huh?
MONICA: Ok.  Um, sure, that'd be great.
MONICA: See ya then.
MONICA: Bye.
RACHEL: Did you just say Hi, Jew?
MONICA: Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
MONICA: Now there you go! I wouldn’t want my best guest to strain her eyes!
PHOEBE: Thanks Monica!
MONICA: Does that smell bother you?
PHOEBE: What the smell from Joey’s? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
MONICA: Well you let me know if you can, because y’know I can bake a pie to cover it.
PHOEBE: I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
MONICA: Okay!
PHOEBE: Okay.
MONICA: Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  It’s for you. It’s the fire inspector.
PHOEBE: Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!
JOEY: Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn’t the hair straightener that started the fire.
JOEY: No-no, it was the candles.
JOEY: It’s very not good leaving candles unattended.
JOEY: In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is…  Uhh… Uhh… Okay.
JOEY: Well, I have to go now.
RACHEL: Joey proposed to me.
MONICA: Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!
RACHEL: Well, I-I said yes.
MONICA: What?!
MONICA: Are you crazy?
MONICA: You just had Ross’s baby!
MONICA: It’s-it’s so  inappropriate.
MONICA: No, it’s worse than that.
MONICA: It’s wrong.
MONICA: It’s… It is bigger than  mine!
RACHEL: I know.
MONICA: You can’t marry him!
RACHEL: Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much.
MONICA: Well do you love him?
RACHEL: Sure.
MONICA: Sure?
RACHEL: Yeah, I mean whatever.
MONICA: Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?
RACHEL: No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
PHOEBE: So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
MRS. GELLER: Here comes the bride.
PHOEBE: Oh my God Monica!
MONICA: I wanna wear this everyday.
RACHEL: You look so beautiful.
MONICA: I’m so happy for me.
RACHEL: Hello?
JOEY: Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
RACHEL: Yeah, we got him back. Everything’s fine.
JOEY: Damnit!
ROSS: I will be! Listen, I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
RACHEL: Fine.
RACHEL: Fine, but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel.
RACHEL: And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want!
ROSS: No that’s not what I want. Uh, I’m glad you guys were bonding but I
RACHEL: Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff!
RACHEL: And I haven’t taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn’t know anyway!
BEN: Crap!!
RACHEL: I gotta go!
MONICA: Look at that! Look at that! They’re going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
CHANDLER: No.
MONICA: Me neither! We have to get in!
CHANDLER: Just act like you belong.
MONICA: Oh my God! Oranges!
CHANDLER: Shh!  Nice to see you again.
AIRLINE EMPLOYEE: Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?
CHANDLER: Yes, of course.
AIRLINE EMPLOYEE: I’m sorry, would you move your thumb? I can’t see the seat number.
CHANDLER: Oh that’s all right, I have it memorized. It’s 1A.
RACHEL: Okay!
RACHEL: Y’know what?
RACHEL: I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.
RACHEL: All I really needed was a plan.
RACHEL: See I wanna have three kids
PHOEBE: Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
RACHEL: As I was saying… I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I’m 35 which gives me five years.
JOEY: You spent a hundred dollars. That’s the limit. You’re screwed!
ROSS: Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,
JOEY: Oh-oh! So that’s the way it’s gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y’know!
ROSS: Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
JOEY: I don’t know.
ROSS: Why am I not surprised?
JOEY: Y’know what Ross? I’m not gonna let you get away with this!
ROSS: I don’t think you have much choice.
JOEY: Well we’ll see!
ROSS: Bye-bye!
JOEY: Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?
ROSS: Yes. Yes. Just here  and there .
ROSS: Dad?
MR. GELLER: I’m here!
ROSS: Hey!
MR. GELLER: Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
ROSS: Dad, we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house.
MR. GELLER: Well, it’s time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
ROSS: Let’s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
MR. GELLER: I’m sorry we can’t store your childhood things anymore.
MONICA: Oh, that’s okay, I can’t wait to see everything again! All of the memories
MR. GELLER: Well, I don’t know what’s in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven
MONICA: I used to
ROSS: Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
MONICA: Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a
ROSS: Ok, got the vent open.
PHOEBE: Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
ROSS: Ben, you ready?
ROSS: All right, gimme your foot.
ROSS: Ok, on three, Ben.
ROSS: One, two, three.
ROSS: Ok, That's it, Ben.
SUSAN: What do you see?
PHOEBE: Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
ROSS: Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
JANITOR: Wait! You forgot your legs!
MR. POSNER: You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
RACHEL: Thank you.
JOANNA: Filing system?
JOANNA: Oh-oh!
JOANNA: You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?
JOANNA: It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
RACHEL: Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
MRS. LYNCH: I notice that you’ve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
RACHEL: Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
JOANNA: Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It’s amazing how she gets it right almost
RACHEL: I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
JOANNA: Oh yes, well there’s the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!
MR. POSNER: Yes, that’s very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
RACHEL: Yes, I realize that
JOANNA: And Rachel shouldn’t have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
RACHEL: I love working with designers!
JOANNA: With them, under them, what’s the difference? Eh, Rach?
RACHEL: Chandler, you have an assistant right?
CHANDLER: Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
MONICA: Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
CHANDLER: I do?
MONICA: Yeah!  All right, maybe you don’t have to smile. Let’s try something else. Let’s try umm, try looking sexy.
CHANDLER: Okay.
MONICA: Or not.
PHOEBE: Where's Chandler?
CHANDLER: Here I am.
PHOEBE: Wash your hands!!!
CHANDLER: How did you…know?
ROSS: Hey! What's she doing back here?
MONICA: Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
ROSS: Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
MONICA: What happened in Atlantic City?!
ROSS: Well, Chandler and I are in a bar
CHANDLER: Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
ROSS: And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?
ROSS: So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.
ROSS: Now, I know what you’re thinking, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you’re right, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls.
MONICA: You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
CHANDLER: In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
ROSS: Oh Mon, I laughed so hard
CHANDLER: Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
ROSS: Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
RACHEL: So umm, you’re gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
MRS. GREEN: Of course I am!
RACHEL: Oh mom, I swear I’m not an idiot.
RACHEL: I’ve read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn’t think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes.
RACHEL: And-and then guess what?
RACHEL: The baby’s coming and I don’t know what to do.
RACHEL: Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?
MRS. GREEN: No. Sweetie, you’re gonna be fine.
RACHEL: Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
MRS. GREEN: I’m going to the bathroom.
RACHEL: Okay.
MRS. GREEN: Now don’t worry! Everything’s gonna be okay.
MONICA: It
ROSS: Hey!
PHOEBE: Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
ROSS: I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
PHOEBE: Not if you were here.
MONICA: Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
RACHEL: Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope it’s you!
PHOEBE: I hope it’s you.
RACHEL: Me too!
MONICA: First of all um, I love you both so much and you’re both so important to me
RACHEL: Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
MONICA: Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.
MONICA: Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine
PHOEBE: Yes!!! Oh!!
RACHEL: Hypothetically!
PHOEBE: Still.
MONICA: If Phoebe were my maid of honor
MONICA: Rachel would be Phoebe’s, I would be Rachel’s, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
RACHEL: Yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea.
PHOEBE: Yeah, I’ll do that. So who gets to be yours?
MONICA: Well that’s the best part. Umm,
PHOEBE: Wh-why is that the best part?
MONICA: Because then I don’t have to!
RACHEL: Well of
MONICA: I’m really not deciding!
RACHEL: Fine!
PHOEBE: Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!
CHANDLER: If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?
MONICA: It's not just the drum noise.
MONICA: Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye!
MONICA: Oh god, my eye!"
MONICA: I mean, it is so annoying.
PHOEBE: Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
MONICA: Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
PHOEBE: Maybe on some level.
RACHEL: Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
JOEY: No, I’m picking you up for our date. These are for you.
RACHEL: Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they’re my favorite. Thank you.
JOEY: And, a brownie!
JOEY: Well, half a brownie.
JOEY: Actually, it’s just bag.
JOEY: It’s been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin’ to feel faint so
RACHEL: Oh man!
RACHEL: This is so great!
RACHEL: I actually feel like I’m going on a real date!
RACHEL: Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I’m wearing underwear that goes up to about……there.
JOEY: Hey come on now, this is a real date.
JOEY: Uh, so…nice place you got here.
JOEY: Foosball, huh?
JOEY: Pizza box.
JOEY: Oh, a subscription to
RACHEL: Yeah, actually that’s my roommate’s.
JOEY: I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
RACHEL: Ah yes, but he’s very protective of me so you’d better watch yourself.
JOEY: Ah… Hey, so this roommate of yours…is he good looking?
RACHEL: Hm-mmm
JOEY: Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
RACHEL: Yeah, but I’m pretty sure he’s gay.
JOEY: No-no-no-no, he’s not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
RACHEL: Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
MONICA: Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
PHOEBE: Ha. Ha, ha.
MONICA: What?
PHOEBE: Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
MONICA: Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
RACHEL: Oh, I beg to differ. The
MONICA: That was
RACHEL: Oooooh.  : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
ROSS: Well, not playing raquetball!
JOEY: He forgot to leave his grip size!
ROSS: He didn't get the goggles!
RACHEL: Well,sounds like you two have issues.
RACHEL: Goodbye, baby.
PAOLO: Ciao, bela.
ROSS: Do they wait for me to do this?
JOEY: So are you gonna tell him?
ROSS: Why would I tell him?
JOEY: How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
MONICA: What are you guys doing here?
JOEY: Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
MONICA: ...What did I ask?
RACHEL: God. I feel violated.
MONICA: Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
CHANDLER: Ross, ten o'clock.
ROSS: Is it? Feels like two.
CHANDLER: No,
CHANDLER: There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
ROSS: Oh. Hel-lo!
CHANDLER: She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
MONICA: Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
CHANDLER: Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
RACHEL: Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
CHANDLER: Oh please, could she
ROSS: He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
PHOEBE: Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
MONICA: You could do that!
CHANDLER: You think?
CHANDLER: OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
PHOEBE: OK.
CHANDLER: This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
CHANDLER: Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
CHANDLER: Last time I do that, I promise.
CHANDLER: I am so, so, so, so sorry!
MONICA: Uh-huh.
CHANDLER: And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
MONICA: Yeah you will!  And, are you kiddin’ me?!
CHANDLER: Come on Monica, it’s our Valentine’s Day. Please? Please-please, please?
MONICA: Okay.
CHANDLER: Okay.
CHANDLER: So, are we going in there?
MONICA: I am!!
ROSS: Wow!
ROSS: It actually is in the handbook.
ROSS: I can’t date you or have a hot plate in my office.
ROSS: I can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other.
ELIZABETH: For what it’s worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
ROSS: I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can’t date. It’s against the rules. It’s forbidden.
ELIZABETH: Wow!
ROSS: What?
ELIZABETH: Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it’s really hot.
ROSS: Really?
ELIZABETH: Yeah.
ROSS: Well I-I-I don’t care how hot it is it’s-it’s uh, it’s wrong.
ELIZABETH: Stop it!
ROSS: No! No! It’s wrong! It’s-it’s-it’s naughty. It’s taboo.
ELIZABETH: Shut the book!
ROSS: Let’s also get a hot plate!
MONICA: Rach, you’re in a great place in your life. Come on, you’ve got a great job! Good friends
MONICA: Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
MEGAN: Oh I’m not, I just like to try these on.
RACHEL: I do the same thing.
MEGAN: I’m just kidding. I’m getting married July 25
RACHEL: I’m just kidding too.  I’m getting married in December.
MEGAN: So when are you getting married?
MONICA: Oh May 15
MEGAN: Oooh it’s getting close!
MEGAN: So uh, who’s your photographer?
MONICA: Jeffrey
MEGAN: We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
MONICA: The best man? Wow!
MEGAN: I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who’s your band?!
MONICA: Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
MEGAN: Oh, you’re so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
PHOEBE: Ooh, is that spelled with a ‘C’ or a ‘K’? Oh my God! It doesn’t matter; they’re both great!
RACHEL: Oh y’know what?
RACHEL: Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman’s and get it half off.
RACHEL: This place is so overpriced.
RACHEL: So, does this  come in another color or
CHANDLER: I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time.
CHANDLER: It was unbelievable!
CHANDLER: We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
MONICA: So have you called her yet?
CHANDLER: Let her know I like her?
CHANDLER: What are you, insane?
CHANDLER: It's the next day!
CHANDLER: How needy do I want to seem?
CHANDLER: I'm right, right?
JOEY AND ROSS: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
MONICA: I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
PHOEBE: Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
CHANDLER: Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.
JOEY: Her answer machine?
CHANDLER: No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
PHOEBE: So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
CHANDLER: Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
MONICA: Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
ROSS: Okay, okay, what's going on?
PHOEBE: Okay, they're just talking...
ROSS: Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
ROSS: So, um, what do you do for a living?
KRISTIN: Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
CAROL: Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
SUSAN: I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
ROSS: Now that is funny.
ROSS: Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?
ROSS: Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
KRISTIN: I guess.
ROSS: Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
CAROL: Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
ROSS: Come on.
ROSS: These people'll scooch down.
ROSS: You guys'll scooch, won't you?
ROSS: Let's try scooching!
ROSS: Come on.
ROSS: Come on.
ROSS: Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.
ROSS: Carol, Kristin.
ROSS: Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade.
ROSS: And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
PAUL: Okay.
PAUL: When I was six years old.
RACHEL: Hm-mm
PAUL: I wanted a big wheel.
PAUL: And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on.
PAUL: It was embarrassing, kids made fun of me.
PAUL: That was a pretty tough year.
RACHEL: That’s-that’s great!
RACHEL: See?
RACHEL: I already feel like I know you a little better!
RACHEL: Thank you.

RACHEL: Let’s go.
PAUL: It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
RACHEL: Oh!
JOEY: Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
CHANDLER: That's patio furniture!
JOEY: So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
CHANDLER: What about the birds?
JOEY: I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
CHANDLER: You pick one.
JOEY: All right, how about the ladybugs?
CHANDLER: Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
JOEY: Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
CHANDLER: Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds!
JOEY: Bijan for men?
JOEY: Bijan for men?
JOEY: Bijan for...   Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
ANNABELLE: Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
HOMBRE MAN: Ready, Annabelle?
ANNABELLE: You bet.  Maybe some other time?
JOEY: Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?!

JOEY: Hey guys!  What 'cha been doin'?
MONICA: Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
JOEY: So what are you gonna do?
ROSS: What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
CHANDLER: Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
ROSS: Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don’t I have to wait a while?
CHANDLER: Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
CHANDLER: Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
JOEY: Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
CHANDLER: Why? What happened to him?
JOEY: Nothing, he’s just really believes in that.
DR. ZANE: It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
PHOEBE: Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
FRANK: Well, okay, so what’s now—go get, go get the eggs, put ‘em in there.
DR. ZANE: Okay, it’ll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
PHOEBE: Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
DR. ZANE: Um-hmm, five actually.
PHOEBE: Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
DR. ZANE: We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
PHOEBE: That’s it! 25 percent? That means that’s it’s like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
FRANK: Hey, y’know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
ALICE: Sweety, now, she’s a woman, not a gumball machine.
PHOEBE: Okay, well y’know what, don’t worry you guys, ‘cause I’m-I’m gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
FRANK: Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
ALICE: Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this.
ALICE: So, umm, we’re kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
PHOEBE: Whoa!! That—okay, that’s a
DR. ZANE: No, I’m sorry.
PHOEBE: Wow! You guys really don’t know anything!
FRANK: I know! Why don’t you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
JOEY: Hey!
MONICA: Hey!
JOEY: You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
PHOEBE: Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
JOEY: Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
MONICA: I don't know, clean places?
JOEY: Mm, yum!
MONICA: It's Danny.
RACHEL: Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
MONICA: We'll be right there!  Can't you just say it starts later?
RACHEL: What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
MONICA: The fake kind!
DANNY: Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
MONICA: We have a ladle.
DANNY: Thanks, see you at the party.
MONICA: Okay, great!
PHOEBE: Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
MONICA: You're so efficient. I love you!
CHANDLER: Let's go!
MONICA: No-no-no! We need something old!
CHANDLER: Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
MONICA: That'll work!
CHANDLER: I don't think so.
MONICA: Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
CHANDLER: Here just…take this.
MONICA: That's stealing!
CHANDLER: No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
MONICA: Ohh.
CHANDLER: Okay, one thing at a time.
BARRY: Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
RACHEL: Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
BARRY: Oh, that's great.
RACHEL: Why are- why are you so tanned?
BARRY: Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
MONICA: Noooo!  I'm lying. I am so drunk.
RACHEL: Oh God, oh.
RACHEL: Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
RACHEL: Monica? Monica!
MONICA: Water rules!
RACHEL: Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
MONICA: Nope. Going to the
RACHEL: Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
MONICA: No, it is me!
MONICA: Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in!
MONICA: Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that.
MONICA: I'm- I'm Monana!
RACHEL: Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
MONICA: Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
RACHEL: What?
MONICA: They've arrested Monica.
JOEY: Note the painterly lines    and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself.
ROSS: Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
JOEY: No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
ROSS: Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y.
ROSS: I just...
ROSS: I wrote that out phonetically for you.
JOEY: Phonetically?
ROSS: Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this.
ROSS: Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that    you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
JOEY: Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days"    I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
ROSS: Wow. What does
JOEY: No idea!
JOEY: But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
ROSS: Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
JOEY: Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .
ROSS: Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't
JOEY: Come on! you...
ROSS: No!
ROSS: Oh.  Oh-oh.
RACHEL: Hey!  What happened to you? Why didn’t you come up?
ROSS: Done!
RACHEL: You just finished?
ROSS: Well, I wanted to be thorough.
ROSS: I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us!
ROSS: And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
RACHEL: So umm, does it?
ROSS: I’m sorry.
RACHEL: Does it?
ROSS: Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole ‘Does it?’ part just another glance.
RACHEL: What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!
RACHEL: Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn’t, and if you have to even
ROSS: No, Rach, no. I don’t, I don’t, I don’t
RACHEL: Are you sure?
ROSS: Oh, sure! I’m sure.
RUSSELL: You got married again.
ROSS: Yes.
RUSSELL: So that’s your second marriage in two years.
ROSS: Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
RUSSELL: Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client.
RUSSELL: Why don’t you tell me what happened.
ROSS: Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk
RUSSELL: I’m sorry, is this the same Rachel who’s name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
ROSS: Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do
RUSSELL: Oh, that’s better then.
ROSS: This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
RUSSELL: I see. Have you considered therapy?
ROSS: I think just the
RUSSELL: There are a couple of forms to fill out.
ROSS: Easy.
RUSSELL: And we’ll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
ROSS: No problem.
RUSSELL: And we’ll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
ROSS: Ooh!
ROSS: There’s no way to do this without her?
ROSS: ‘Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
ROSS: So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
JOEY: But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
PHOEBE: Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
JOEY: What?
PHOEBE: Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
CHANDLER: That's alright, I'll take it.
CHANDLER: Bad things happen to me anyway.
CHANDLER: This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
ROSS: Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...

RACHEL: Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
ROSS: It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.
ROSS: And I do, I have to make
RACHEL: Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That
ROSS: You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
RACHEL: Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
ROSS: What are you doing?
RACHEL: Storming out!
ROSS: Rachel, this is your apartment.
RACHEL: Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
JOEY: These little women. Wow!
CHANDLER: Your liking it, huh?

RACHEL: Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
PHOEBE: Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we’re gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.
FRANK: Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars.
FRANK: And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.
CHANDLER: You know, we don’t really take advantage of living in the city.
RACHEL: Okay, Chandler!
CHANDLER: Okay.
RACHEL: And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
CHANDLER: Oh, well thank you in advance.
RACHEL: Op, but the twelfth brings a lover’s spat.
RACHEL: Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
JOEY: Hey guys!
CHANDLER: Hey!!
RACHEL: Oh my God! It’s Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
CHANDLER: Oh that’s right. It’s your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
JOEY: Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I’ve dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
PHOEBE: No! Joey, you’re going to be great!
JOEY: But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don’t know anything about technology!
JOEY: I can’t even use Chandler’s computer except to find porn!
JOEY: And-and that’s only ‘cause it’s right there when you turn it on!
MONICA: I think our lover’s spat will start a little early this month.
PHOEBE: I’ll be waiting.
MONICA: Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
RACHEL: Oh my God! It sure didn’t look this way when I lived here.
MONICA: I know!
MONICA: Now look, there’s only one problem though.
MONICA: There’s only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s.
PHOEBE: Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.
RACHEL: Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one’s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
PHOEBE: Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
RACHEL: Okay!
MONICA: So Rach!
MONICA: You’re the first guest at Hotel Monica!
MONICA: Umm, you’ll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning.
MONICA: And I thought I would bring them to you, y’know, in bed.
MONICA: Oh, you have been through so much.
RACHEL: I have.
MONICA: This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
JOEY: Sorry, that was wax.
PHOEBE: Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
ROSS: Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
RACHEL: During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
ROSS: Yeah?
ROSS: Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this.
ROSS: But I'll still always come back, like this.
ROSS: And sometimes I may be away longer, like this.
ROSS: But I'll still always come back, like this.
CHANDLER: And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
MONICA: He is so amazing.
RACHEL: Oh, I know. Look at him.
JOEY: Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
PHOEBE: Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes.  Look, he's opening his eyes.

CHANDLER: So apparently we just don’t pay for food anymore.  Do you see what I see?
MONICA: How did it go?
CHANDLER: Had the money in the wrong hand.
MONICA: All right, I’m gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
RACHEL: I’ll do it.
MONICA: Who wants it? Anybody?
RACHEL: I said I’ll do it!
MONICA: Nobody wants to do it? All right, I’ll do it myself.

BOB: Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.
PHOEBE: Well, because we thought you knew!! It’s so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean."
CHANDLER: Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
JOEY: Oh no, I can’t go. I’m practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.
ROSS: Oh cool!

CHANDLER: You’ll be perfect for this! That’s already your name!
JOEY: But the audition’s in a couple hours and I don’t even understand the game.
ROSS: Well do you want some help?
JOEY: Oh really? That’d be great! You guys can be the contestants!
ROSS: Awesome!

ROSS: Oh. Okay, just breathe.
JULIE: Oh honey, I think I’m having one too!
MARC: Look at this!  There we go!
ROSS: Excuse me. Hi, I’m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
THE LIBRARIAN: Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
ROSS: No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
THE HEAD LIBRARIAN: How can I help you?
ROSS: Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section?
ROSS: See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
THE HEAD LIBRARIAN: We are aware of the problem you are referring to.
THE HEAD LIBRARIAN: But as far as increasing security, I’m afraid the library is very understaffed.
THE HEAD LIBRARIAN: I, I can’t help you.
ROSS: Well, fine.
ROSS: Fine!
ROSS: If-if I’m the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I’ll go up there and defend it myself!
ROSS: And don’t you follow me!
PHOEBE: Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
RACHEL: Oh my God! Phoebe look, it’s Ross and that girl.
PHOEBE: No! No! Look at that!  It’s a line of ants! They’re working as a team!
PHOEBE: Right, oh yeah.
PHOEBE: Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her.
PHOEBE: Uff, I hope he lets her down easy.
RACHEL: Come on Phoebe, look at that!
RACHEL: They are not breaking up, look at them.
RACHEL: Okay that’s, you know what that is?

PHOEBE: Oh no! That really is nothing, she is
RACHEL: Ohh!  Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he’s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.

MONICA: You still work at the multiplex?
CHIP: Oh, like I’d give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.
MONICA: Thanks, I’m set. Do you still live with your parents?
CHIP: Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.

ROSS: Uh fellas,
CHANDLER: Okay, so he's out of here.
CHANDLER: Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
JOEY: I know it doesn't make much sense
CHANDLER: Much
JOEY: Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
CHANDLER: So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
JOEY: I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!
CHANDLER: So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
JOEY: No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
CHANDLER: Really?!
JOEY: Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me,  here.
CHANDLER: Thanks.
JOEY: No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
JOEY: How good is that?
CHANDLER: Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
JOEY: See?
JOEY: Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
CHANDLER: I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
JOEY: Yeah. With a bite!  Gee-e-e-eez!
CHANDLER: Check out the ring.
RACHEL: Nice! One and a half carat easy.
PHOEBE: Hi.
ROSS: Hey-hey Pheebs!
ROSS: Chandler’s gonna ask Monica to marry him!
PHOEBE: Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
ROSS: You told her before you told us?
CHANDLER: Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right?  Guys? Guys?
MONICA: Let's see.
MONICA: Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
PHOEBE: What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
MONICA: Nah... not-not special enough.
PHOEBE: Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
MONICA: Waaay too special.
JOEY: Hey Pheebs!
PHOEBE: Hey!
JOEY: Check it out.  How much of a man am I?!
PHOEBE: Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
JOEY: Y’know, I’m beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
PHOEBE: Uh-huh.
JOEY: The silk? Feels really good!
CASSIE: Ah yeah, sorry about that.
ROSS: It’s okay. Come, come on in.
CASSIE: Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica’s place was nice, but her fiancée sure stares a lot.
ROSS: Oh.
CASSIE: Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
ROSS: Uh-huh. Yeah, I-I have a knack for impressions.
CASSIE: Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
ROSS: Yeah—No!!
JOEY: Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out!  Guess which job I got.
CHANDLER: I don’t know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
ROSS: What?
CHANDLER: Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
RACHEL: But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
CHANDLER: Well, you-you know what I meant.
MONICA: No, you messed it up. You’re stupid.
CHANDLER: So what job did you get Joe?
JOEY: Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
RACHEL: Well, how can you be a tour guide, don’t you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
CHANDLER: I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
ROSS: Y'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured, you’re in for a
CHANDLER: It just keeps getting worse and worse!
CHANDLER: I mean it’s bad enough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, I think she knows.
CHANDLER: Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like energy between us.
CHANDLER: And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too.
CHANDLER: And now I have seen her naked.
CHANDLER: I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something.
CHANDLER: But there are no boles, she’s smooth!
CHANDLER: Smooth!
PHOEBE: Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
ALL: Yeah! Oh my God!
JOEY: So, you and Angela, huh?
BOB: Yep. Pretty much.
JOEY: Oh, that's what she meant!
JOEY: You know, if they're    gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE!
JOEY: You know, short for museum,    and avoid all the confusion!
ROSS: Yeah, most of it it's a place
JOEY: Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.
ROSS: Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison    Avenue.
ROSS: You know what?
ROSS: She loves architecture, you know what you should do?
ROSS: You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there    there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
JOEY: Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
ROSS: But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for    Thai food...
JOEY: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go
ROSS: Ok.
JOEY: You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
ROSS: Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities    wing.
ROSS: Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
JOEY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make    the right
ROSS: Hey!
RACHEL: Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
ROSS: Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of.
RACHEL: Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
ROSS: Oh yeah, why not?
RACHEL: Pheebs?
PHOEBE: No thanks, I’ve already seen one.
RACHEL: Okay, umm, I’m gonna get my sweater.
ROSS: Okay.  You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
PHOEBE: Always.
ROSS: I didn’t get the annulment.
PHOEBE: What?!
ROSS: We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later.
JOEY: Hey! Are you okay?
KATE: Fabulous.
JOEY: Listen, drama critics they’re nothing but, but people who couldn’t make it as actors. You know what you should do?
ROSS: Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right?
CHLOE: Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
ROSS: You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven’t actually met...
ISSAC: You dog!
ROSS: Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
ISSAC: Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
ROSS: Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her.
ISSAC: Oh, hey, man I know, doesn’t matter how much we love ‘em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
ROSS: Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
ISSAC: Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We’re the same, you and me.
ROSS: Actually, no, we’re not.
ISSAC: Yeah, we are.
ROSS: No, we’re not.
ISSAC: Yeah, we are.
ROSS: No, we’re not!!
ISSAC: Okay, we’re not.
ROSS: Right.
ISSAC: But, we are.
ROSS: Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister.
ISSAC: I can promise not to tell her again.
ROSS: Emily!
EMILY: Oh my God! What are you doing here?
ROSS: I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
EMILY: You are so sweet.
ROSS: That’s, that’s, that’s a big candy bar. (She’s holding one of those huge
EMILY: Me too.
EMILY: Well, that’ me.  Here, have this.  I’m only allowed one piece of carryon anyway.
ROSS: Wait uh, listen.
ROSS: I-I, I have to tell you something.
ROSS: Umm, I’ve been thinking, I’m just gonna come out and say it.
ROSS: Okay?
ROSS: I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
EMILY: Oh.  Thank you.
ROSS: That’s no problem.
CHANDLER: Monica!
MONICA: She’s sleeping.
CHANDLER: I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was
MONICA: Deep Impact
CHANDLER: Sorry, I just…can’t sleep.
CHANDLER: Ooh!
CHANDLER: Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it?
CHANDLER: Because every time I look at that cover I’m like
MONICA: It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
MONICA: Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section
ROSS: Yeah?
MONICA: Look at this.
ROSS: Oh, it looks like mom and dad’s house.
ROSS: Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is…Oh my God!
PHOEBE: What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
MONICA: I can’t believe mom and dad are selling the house!
ROSS: I can’t believe they-they didn’t even tell us!
PHOEBE: I can’t believe I still don’t know what happened to the
JOEY'S HAND TWIN: Nothing?
JOEY: Look, you and I have been given a gift.
JOEY: We have to do something with it.
JOEY: Like-like, hand modeling!
JOEY: Or-or magic!
JOEY'S HAND TWIN: I have to get back to
JOEY: Whoa!
JOEY: Whoa!
JOEY: We could have our own show!
JOEY: Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it!
JOEY: Huh?
JOEY: And-and-and I wrote a song for us!
JOEY: (Singing, to the tune of
JOEY'S HAND TWIN: That's okay.
JOEY: But you haven't even heard the chorus!
MR. GELLER: Well, she’ll understand right? It’s not like I did it on purpose.
ROSS: Dad, that won’t matter to her.
ROSS: Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all hers is-is, is growing new stuff!
ROSS: See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
MR. GELLER: Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
ROSS: Well, can you blame her?
MR. GELLER: Well I don’t know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could
ROSS: Dad, dad I don’t want to hear about it.
MR. GELLER: Really?
ROSS: Well, not right now.
ROSS: Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we’re gonna give her some!
ROSS: Okay, grab…grab some empty boxes.
ROSS: Okay?
ROSS: We’ll-we’ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we’ll-we’ll put ‘em in there.
RACHEL: Y’know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
JOEY: You could?
RACHEL: Yeah! I’ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
PHOEBE: Your own boat?
RACHEL: What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
ROSS: He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!
MONICA: Count in our heads as-as good
JOEY: I guess I'm done.
CHANDLER: Fun’s over
MONICA: Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
JOEY: I think I'm gonna take-off.
MONICA: Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun!  Ohhh!
CHANDLER: Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it
SHELLEY: Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
CHANDLER: Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
SHELLEY: Do you want a date Saturday?
CHANDLER: Yes please.
SHELLEY: Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-
CHANDLER: He's a he?
SHELLEY: Well yeah!
SHELLEY: ...Oh God.
SHELLEY: I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley.
SHELLEY: I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now...
SHELLEY: Okay, goodbye...
CHANDLER: Well, it's official there are no good movies.
JANICE: Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.
MONICA: Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this,  so that you can bunny bump against my back.
JOEY: Hey!
PHOEBE: Hey.
CHANDLER: Hey, man. What's up?
JOEY: Maybe you can tell me.
JOEY: My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today.
JOEY: The first good thing she gets me in weeks.
JOEY: How could you not give me the message?
CHANDLER: Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
PHOEBE: Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me!
CHANDLER: See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
ROSS: Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
JOEY: Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
ROSS: There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me.
JOEY: Whoa!
RACHEL: Whoa what?
JOEY: Ross has a boyfriend.
ROSS: I do-I do
RACHEL: Really?
ROSS: Yeah!
ROSS: I don’t know.
ROSS: I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid.
ROSS: What-what-what-what is it?!
ROSS: Am I giving out some kind of…sexy professor vibe?
RACHEL: Not right now.
ROSS: It-it—The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
RACHEL: Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid!
RACHEL: I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard!
RACHEL: Y’know you—I couldn’t concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me.
RACHEL: I mean come on, you remember what’s it’s like to be 19 and in love.
RACHEL: Oh yes! Thank you very much!  Oh that’s-that’s actually how the French drink it.
MONICA: A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man!  Yes!
CHANDLER: Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
MONICA: That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
CHANDLER: Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
MONICA: Pick a number! That is your
CHANDLER: 8. 8!
MONICA: Thank you!
CHANDLER: If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
RICHARD: Yeah, I understand.
RICHARD: Take as much time as you want.
RICHARD: Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it.
RICHARD: I’ll be here.
RICHARD: Not smoking.
ROSS: We’re really gonna do this, huh?
CAROL: Looks like it.
ROSS: Y’know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at
CAROL: I got it!
ROSS: Okay.
CAROL: Susan! Hi!
SUSAN: Hey!
CAROL: Thank you so much for coming.
SUSAN: Oh, I wouldn’t miss it for the world.
ROSS: I’m-I’m Ross by the way.
SUSAN: Hello Ross.  I love what you’ve done with this space.
CAROL: Thank you so much.
ROSS: How hot is this?!
ROSS: Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben.  'A real American hero. I'm
RACHEL: G.I. Joe
ROSS: Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
MONICA: It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
CHANDLER: That, that's what's stupid.
MONICA: I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers.
MONICA: And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
RACHEL: Down at the docks again?
ROSS: Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?
GIRL: I’m not gonna tell you! You’re the bad man who broke Sarah’s leg.
ROSS: Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
GIRL: You’re a big scrud.
ROSS: What’s a scrud?
GIRL: Why don’t you look in the mirror, scrud.
ROSS: I don’t have too. I can just look at you.
LEADER: All right girls, and man. Let’s see your final tallies.  Ohhhh, Debbie,  321 boxes of cookies,  Very nice.
ROSS: Not nice enough.
LEADER: Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
MONICA: So, how’d the lasagne go over?
MONICA: Really?!
MONICA: Good.
MONICA: So you owe me three pretty things.
MONICA: Yeah, I’ve been thinking a lot about you too.
MONICA: It’s hard this whole platonic thing.
MONICA: It’s a word!
MONICA: Yeah, I do think it’s better this way.  Yeah, we’re being smart.   Yes, I’m sure.
RICHARD: You really sure?
MONICA: I’ll call you back.
CHANDLER: So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
MONICA: Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
CHANDLER: Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary… Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together.
CHANDLER: But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary.
CHANDLER: I am
MONICA: I think you're better than you think you are.
CHANDLER: Really? Okay, so
MONICA: Know when to stop.
CHANDLER: Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
MONICA: Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen.  Don't do the dance.
CHANDLER: Right!
FRANK: Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!
PHOEBE: Hey!-Hey! What’s going on?
FRANK: She broke my arm.
GIRL: He touched my fanny.
FRANK: No, she touched mine first!
GIRL: That’s my job!
JANICE: Are you being British?!
CHANDLER: No. Not anymore.
JANICE: Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
CHANDLER: Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
JANICE: Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
CHANDLER: Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
JANICE: Where is this party?
CHANDLER: Here in Chelsea.
JANICE: Who's party is it?
CHANDLER: A woman's
JANICE: What woman?!
CHANDLER: Chelsea.
JANICE: Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet.
JANICE: Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle.
JANICE: So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
CHANDLER: Can I be that guy?
CHANDLER: Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
DANA: Y’know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
CHANDLER: Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
DANA: Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don’t feel that way about you.
CHANDLER: Oh no-no-no, that’s not—No-no-no!
MONICA: Did you just flick me?
RACHEL: OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica]
PHOEBE: Oh!  All right.  Now, let's not do this!
PHOEBE: Happy thoughts!  Happy thoughts!
PHOEBE: OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
RACHEL: Ow! Ow! Ow!
PHOEBE: Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
RACHEL: Fine!
MONICA: Fine!
PHOEBE: There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
JOEY: Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
CHANDLER: Oh my God!
JOEY: Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I
JOEY: Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on.
JOEY: I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
CHANDLER: Hi.
MONICA: Hi.
CHANDLER: Hi, listen, I’m sorry about before.
CHANDLER: I don’t need to have a game room.
CHANDLER: I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn’t get girls, and now I
MONICA: Stop it Chandler.  I’m sorry too.
CHANDLER: Really?
MONICA: Yeah! Oh yes!
CHANDLER: Ohh.
MONICA: Listen, we don’t have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
CHANDLER: That’s a great idea! We can
MONICA: Totally!
CHANDLER: We don’t have to come up with this now.
MONICA: Oh good.
RACHEL: Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
PHOEBE: That’s great. Good for you guys.
MONICA: I am not high maintenance!
RACHEL: I am not a pushover!
PHOEBE: Who said you were?
RACHEL: You did!
PHOEBE: Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything.
RACHEL: Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
ROSS: That does not sound stupid to me.
ROSS: You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?
ROSS: I'm sorry, that's all the time we have.
ROSS: Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
RACHEL: What uh-oh?
ROSS: Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done.
ROSS: It's, uh, it's a song.
ROSS: The laundry song that we sing.
ROSS: Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
RACHEL: Ross, what's the matter?
ROSS: Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
CHANDLER: Why are you here?
JANICE: Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we...
CHANDLER: No no no... I mean,
JANICE: Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in    a cup!  Oh! They gave you the kiddy size .
CHANDLER: What!?
MONICA: This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!
CHANDLER: I'd love to stay, but I have eh...  got    a hot date...
JANICE: Please... go!  Just let me know if you    need a hand!
CHANDLER: I think it just fell off.
ROSS: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
CHANDLER: And I just want a million dollars!
MONICA: Rachel?!
CHANDLER: Yeah.
MONICA: Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em!
MONICA: And we're not a couple of suckers!
CHANDLER: I hear ya, Mugsy!
CHANDLER: But look, all these rooms are fine okay?
CHANDLER: Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
MONICA: Okay,
CHANDLER: Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
MONICA: Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
CHANDLER: Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
MONICA: Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
CHANDLER: Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
MONICA: I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
CHANDLER: Do not speak ill of the dead.
MONICA: We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
CHANDLER: I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
MONICA: What did you say?
CHANDLER: I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
MONICA: Y’know, maybe it’s best that we never got to do it again.
CHANDLER: Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special.  Y’know, technically we still
MONICA: I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?
CHANDLER: ‘Kay!
JOEY: Can I ask you something?
CHANDLER: Uhh, no.
JOEY: Felicity and I, we’re watching
CHANDLER: No.
JOEY: I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y’know, you think I’ll ever get there?
CHANDLER: Yes.
JOEY: Thanks man.
CHANDLER: Okay man.
JOEY: But what about how much taller he is than me?
JOEY: I mean, there’s no way I can make myself taller now, y’know?
JOEY: And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
JOEY: Hey, Monica, wow you’ve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
MONICA: I know!
JOEY: Had the beef-tips, huh?
DR. WESLEY: Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.
DR. DRAKE REMORAY: Not so fast Wesley!
DR. WESLEY: Ramoray!
DR. DRAKE REMORAY: That’s right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you’re not a real doctor! And that woman’s brain, is fine!
RACHEL: Oh! Thank God!

PHOEBE: You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
RACHEL: Oh honey he doesn’t need my help.
PHOEBE: Oh, come on! I think he’s ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
ROSS: Really?!
ROSS: Hey, y’know what?
ROSS: Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here’s-here’s 60 bucks, why don’t you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.

PHOEBE: You mean the—Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
RICK: Yeah.
PHOEBE: Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y’know, real  nice and tight.
PHOEBE: So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
RICK: Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.

PHOEBE: No.

MARK: Um, y'know, before we go ah, there’s something I need to say.
RACHEL: Oh, okay.
MARK: I’ve kinda of had this ah, this crush on you.
MARK: But since you were with Ross, I-I didn’t do anything about it.
MARK: But, now that you’re not, I’d really like to ask you out sometime.

PHOEBE: Uh-huh.  Good luck.
ROSS: Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
RACHEL: Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so
MAN: I'm not your brother.
PHOEBE/WAITRESS: What about my children Drake?! Huh!?  No!! No!! No! God!
NURSE: Why don’t we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.
JOEY: Are you kidding me?!
RACHEL: It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!
JOEY: I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy!
JANINE: Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.

JOEY: All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay?
JOEY: You're hot.
JOEY: I'm lovable.

JOEY: Okay?
JOEY: Umm, look I like you.
JOEY: I-I really do, I like you a lot.
JOEY: Okay?
JOEY: But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very
KATIE: Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
RACHEL: Oh, Joey! Sorry!
RACHEL: They made you head of the department!

RACHEL: Ooh, I miss dating.
RACHEL: Gettin’ all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant.
RACHEL: I’m not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it’s so much fun!
RACHEL: I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
JOEY: Hey, y’know what?
RACHEL: Huh?
JOEY: Why don’t I take you out?
RACHEL: What?! Joey, you don’t want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
JOEY: Yes I do!
JOEY: And we’re gonna go out, we’re gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out
RACHEL: Okay! I’ll go with ya! I’ll go! I’ll go with ya.
JOEY: I’ll be fun.
RACHEL: All right?
RACHEL: Hi!
JOEY: Hey!
RACHEL: Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking
JOEY: Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good,    and... and my co-star's good
RACHEL: God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
JOEY: Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with    me?
RACHEL: Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
JOEY: Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
RACHEL: Oh screw her, that part is mine!
JOEY: Right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
RACHEL: Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you    here.
JOEY/DRAKE: I can't believe you married him.
RACHEL/ACTRESS: But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister    in a
JOEY/DRAKE: So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
RACHEL/ACTRESS: It's over! You
JOEY/DRAKE: How can I?
JOEY/DRAKE: Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?
JOEY/DRAKE: How can I accept that...
JOEY/DRAKE: I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.
RACHEL: Kiss me.
JOEY: What?
PHOEBE: Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
JOEY: The bigger half.
CHANDLER: I'd like to propose a toast.
CHANDLER: Little toast here, ding ding.
CHANDLER: I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
CHANDLER: Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?
CHANDLER: So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
ALL: That's so sweet.
ROSS: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
RACHEL: And a crappy New Year.
CHANDLER: Here, here!
ROSS: Now, hold on!
ROSS: Hold on!
ROSS: Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I’m gonna be at that airport and I hope that she’ll be there too!
ROSS: Oh yeah, I said Rachel’s name, but it didn’t mean anything, Okay?
ROSS: She’s-she’s just a friend and that’s all!
ROSS: That’s all!
ROSS: Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can’t imagine spending my life with anyone else.
ROSS: Please, promise me that you’ll tell her that.
MR. WALTHAM: All right, I’ll tell her.  Come on bugger face!
MRS. WALTHAM: Call me.
MR. WALTHAM: You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don’t you ever go out the bloody window!
ROSS: What happened?!!
JOEY: Well, I don’t know!!
ROSS: We fell asleep! That is all.
JOEY: Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I’d better go.
ROSS: I think that would be best.
JOEY: Yeah. All right, I’ll talk to you later.
ROSS: Okay. But not about this!
JOEY: No! Never! Never!  Bye.
ROSS: No touch! No touch!
CHANDLER: Umm ma’am, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa.
MS. MCKENNA: What?
CHANDLER: It’s a funny story, actually.
CHANDLER: I kind of fell asleep  in the meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa, I didn’t really  know what I was saying.
MS. MCKENNA: You fell asleep?
CHANDLER: But only because I was up all night worried about this  meeting, ain’t that funny?
CHANDLER: Irony?
CHANDLER: Not a fan, alright .
CHANDLER: See, here’s  the thing.
CHANDLER: I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go.
CHANDLER: See, me, I  love Tulsa!
CHANDLER: Tulsa is heaven!
CHANDLER: Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go  there!
MS. MCKENNA: Chandler, I…
CHANDLER: No no no!
CHANDLER: Look, Carol, can I call you Carol?
CHANDLER: Wh-why  would I when your name is Elaine?
CHANDLER: Oh what a great picture of your son,  strapping!

FAKE MONICA: That I was not expecting.
MONICA: I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
FAKE MONICA: Oh. Thanks.

MINDY: Oh no.
RACHEL: Oh, I am so sorry.
MINDY: No me, I am so sorry...
JOEY: Oh my.
ROSS: Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot.
ROSS: Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
MONICA: Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
ROSS: Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
MONICA: My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
DOCTOR: No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
ROSS: Tho?
ROSS: Ohhh.
MONICA: That's good, have a seat.
MONICA: Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle.
MONICA: You're just gonna have to be brave, ok?
MONICA: Can you do that for me?
ROSS: Ok.
MONICA: Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand?
ROSS: Yes!
MONICA: All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.
MONICA: Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard!
MONICA: Let go of my hand!
ROSS: You’re gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!!
PHOEBE: Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
ROSS: Well…let’s just say
PHOEBE: Oo, where are the seats?
ROSS: Uh, middle balcony.
BOY IN THE CAPE: You’re a mean old woman.
RACHEL: No! Wait no! Shut up—I mean don’t cry! Let me get my checkbook!
MONICA: Look honey, you don’t have to do this, okay?
MONICA: It’s the strength you have inside that means the most to me.
MONICA: You’re loyal, you’re honest, and you have integrity!
MONICA: That’s the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
CHANDLER: That means nothing to me.  Come on!
RACHEL: Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
MR. TREEGER: : What are you doing?
RACHEL: Ummm. Oh! I’m sorry.  It’s a little old but

MR. TREEGER: : You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh?
MR. TREEGER: Well, why don’t think of someone else for a change?
RACHEL: Okay, I’m sorry.
ROSS: Hello!
ROSS: What's this?
ROSS: Oh right its that girl's phone number.
ROSS: Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me.

ROSS: Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby!
ROSS: Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.
PHOEBE: Thank you.
MONICA: I don’t know how any of these got opened?!
JOEY: You opened them all?
MONICA: I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!
JOEY: Oh hey! You got my parent’s gift!
MONICA: Yeah. What is that?
JOEY: Well, I don’t know. I think it does something to salami.
MONICA: Hey! How’d it go?
JOEY: Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
RACHEL: Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
JOEY: I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you.
RACHEL: Oh wow, you didn’t even try to unhook my bra!
MONICA: So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
RACHEL: No, I will. I’m just not up for it tonight.
JOEY: Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you’re not gonna be alone in this.
RACHEL: I’m not?
JOEY: Listen I uh…  It’s a scary world out there especially if you’re a single mom.
JOEY: Y’know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond.
JOEY: So,  Rachel Green will you marry me?
RACHEL: Thank you.
JOEY: If I can’t have it you can’t have it!
MONICA: I can’t believe her, y’know it’s just—it’s so typical.
CHANDLER: Now Monica, I know you’re upset, but don’t forget.
CHANDLER: There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and
MONICA: Paris?
CHANDLER: We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
MONICA: Keep talking.
CHANDLER: Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it’s romantic, but because I can!
MONICA: I love you!
JOEY: Yes!
JOEY: I win again!
JOEY: Ha-ha!
JOEY: That’s like 500 bucks you owe me!
JOEY: Whoo-ho-hoo!
JOEY: $500 that is a loooot of electricity!
JOEY: Whoo-ho-ho!
JOEY: I gotta buy some food.
CHANDLER: Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
JOEY: You serious?
CHANDLER: Oh yes!
JOEY: Okay, get ready to owe me!
CHANDLER: Okay.
JOEY: Okay, here we go. Ready?
CHANDLER: No! No! No! No——one can beat me.
CHANDLER: See? Now, that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
MONICA: Who is that?!
CHANDLER: Don’t worry, I’m brave!
CHANDLER: I am brave!
CHANDLER: I…I am brave!
CHANDLER: No-no-no-no!!
CHANDLER: Can you tell me who is there please?

CHANDLER: I am sorry, but some of us have to
MONICA: Umm, listen I am sorry, but I’ll put some out first thing in the morning.

GARY: Mm! Seems like I would’ve remembered you!
CHANDLER: Mm! Night Gar’!
JOEY: Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy’s hammered!
THE DIRECTOR: I’m sorry Joey, as long as he’s here and he’s conscious we’re still shooting.
RICHARD: You wouldn’t happen to have a very big fork?
JOEY: So I uh, I just talked to the director. That’s it, we’re done for the day.
RICHARD: Well have we finished the scene?
JOEY: Yeah! You…you were wonderful.
RICHARD: As were you.
JOEY: So I got your car, it’s right outside.
RICHARD: Oh, thank you. You’re welcome.

CHANDLER: Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
ROSS: Mm-Hm
MONICA: I know that there’s no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
RACHEL: Oh my God! Look at this!
MONICA: Okay, but there
RACHEL: I don’t care! The wires have come loose in your head!
MONICA: I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
RACHEL: And did you?!
MONICA: No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
MONICA: But it didn’t. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
RACHEL: Oh my God.
MRS. CHATRACUS: Hello darling.
RACHEL: Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
ROSS: Okay, is everybody clear? We’re gonna pick it up…and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We’re gonna

CARL: Another
JOEY: That’s right! And what are you not gonna do?
CARL: Well, I’m not gonna talk because
MONICA: I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but
JANICE: Oh?my Gawd, I-I understand.
JANICE: I-I am so sorry, I’ll go.
JANICE: Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.
JANICE: Chandler,  you call me when this goes in the pooper.
JOEY: I found my identical hand twin!
PHOEBE: Ohh, you are
CHANDLER: No!
PHOEBE: But she just came up here!
CHANDLER: That was Joey!
PHOEBE: I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
CHANDLER: Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
PHOEBE: Would you stop that!
PHOEBE: Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard?
PHOEBE: She didn't feel anything for him.
PHOEBE: She loves you!
CHANDLER: Really?
PHOEBE: Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
CHANDLER: Okay.
PHOEBE: Good.  I should really start wearing hats!
MONICA: I mean, why should I let them meet him?
MONICA: I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him.
MONICA: I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
PAULA: Listen.
PAULA: As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing.
PAULA: I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
MONICA: I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
PAULA: Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
CHANDLER: No-no-no-no.  Hey!
PHOEBE: Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
MONICA: Hey sweetie.
CHANDLER: Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
MONICA: I can’t tell you. It’s a secret.
CHANDLER: Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
MONICA: Awww.  But still no.
CHANDLER: No I’m serious, we should tell each other
MONICA: Really? Okay, so why don’t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at

PHOEBE: Oh! You got it?!
JOEY: Well no, not yet. But the audition went really good.
MONICA: What was it for?
JOEY: Oh, it’s this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century.

ELIZABETH: Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
ROSS: What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
ELIZABETH: Who?
ROSS: Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone’s name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames.
ROSS: Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
ELIZABETH: Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
ROSS: Umm, no. No.
ELIZABETH: Yes you did! What was it?
ROSS: Umm, it’s Cutie McPretty.
ELIZABETH: Ohh that’s so sweet!
ROSS: Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I’m having a great time!
ROSS: Y’know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it’s not.
ROSS: I mean it’s not at all.
BURT: Dr. Geller!
ROSS: Burt!

RACHEL: Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
PHOEBE: Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
ROSS: You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
PHOEBE: What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
CHANDLER: Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
PHOEBE: What are you saying I should do?
MONICA: I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
PHOEBE: Thank you, Monica.
JOEY: Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
MONICA: Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
MONICA: Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
PHOEBE: Ooh, let’s see it!
JOEY: She’s not crazy is she?
MONICA: No.
JOEY: So uh, how you doin’?

JOEY: I-I wasn’t in that.
PHOEBE: Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
MONICA: So then you know?
PHOEBE: The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.

MONICA: Okay, all right don’t judge me to much.
MONICA: Okay?
MONICA: Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop.
MONICA: But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
PHOEBE: Oh, it’s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.
MONICA: I know!!

WOMAN: Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
RACHEL: But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
WOMAN: Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.
RACHEL: What?
WOMAN: No suds, no save. Ok?
ROSS: What's goin' on?
RACHEL: Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
ROSS: Was your basket on top?
RACHEL: Yeah, but, there were no suds.
ROSS: So?
RACHEL: Well, you know, no suds, no save.
ROSS: No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine.
WOMAN: Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
ROSS: Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
PHOEBE: Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that    this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
RECEPTIONIST: Well, I think this is a great place to work!
PHOEBE: Ok, are they listening?

RACHEL: This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at.
RACHEL: I mean.
RACHEL: if you don’t get that...
ROSS: No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time.

ROSS: Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
CHANDLER: Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
PHOEBE: Oh, which museum?
PHOEBE: No, answer his.
ROSS: Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars.
ROSS: She was totally at my mercy.
CHANDLER: Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
ROSS: No, I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie.
ROSS: She seems really great, but she’s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
CHANDLER: How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie?  That joke would’ve killed in Albany.
JOEY: Done! I did it! Heh, who’s stupid now?
MONICA: No, there is no way! It can
CHANDLER: Why is your family
MONICA: He cannot play at our wedding!
MONICA: I mean everyone will leave!

PHOEBE: Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!
MONICA: So do you think that these pictures—Are, are they trying to tell a story?
RACHEL: Oh, yeah, sure.
RACHEL: I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where are they, where are they?’
MONICA: Well, she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
PHOEBE: Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
MONICA: Yeah.
RACHEL: You see, now, I would date this girl.
RACHEL: She’s cute, she’s outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire.
RACHEL: I mean, that’s got to come in handy
MONICA: Okay, I’ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
RACHEL: I don’t know.
MONICA: Me neither.
PHOEBE: Rachel.
MONICA: What?!
PHOEBE: I don’t know.  Me neither.
MONICA: Look, I wanted to tell I’m-I’m sorry you lost.
CHANDLER: Listen, I’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win.
MONICA: Is that a secret or a lie.
CHANDLER: No, I let him win—Ross!

JOEY: Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?
ROSS: Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten
JOEY: Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
ROSS: Also an island.
JOEY: Hey, what time is it?
ROSS: 2:17.
JOEY: Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
ROSS: Are you serious?!
JOEY: Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
ROSS: Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
JOEY: Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
RACHEL: Hey, you guys
JOEY: Hey!
URSULA: Who is it?
PHOEBE: It’s Phoebe! Phoebe!
URSULA: Hey!
PHOEBE: Oh God. So-so you’re making porn movies.
URSULA: No I’m not.
PHOEBE: You’re making one right now!
PHOEBE: And-
URSULA: Yeah, can I help you with something?
PHOEBE: Look, I’m talking right now! You’re—you mean her.
URSULA: Y’know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.
PHOEBE: What?!
URSULA: Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.
PHOEBE: No!!
PHOEBE: And stop using my name!
PHOEBE: And shame on you!
PHOEBE: And shame on all of you!
PHOEBE: You’re disgusting!
PHOEBE: Especially you  with that!
PHOEBE: Hey!
RACHEL: Hi Pheebs!
PHOEBE: Are you moving out?
RACHEL: No, these aren't all my suitcases.  This one's Paolo's.
PHOEBE: Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
RACHEL: Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
PHOEBE: Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,
RACHEL: Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
PHOEBE: Ok, um,  we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me.
PHOEBE: One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
RACHEL: Ok, thanks Pheebs  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
PHOEBE: Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
RACHEL: All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
PHOEBE: Which proves that I never lie.
RACHEL: I guess you don't.
PHOEBE: Paolo made a pass at me.
MONICA: I’m so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
CHANDLER: I’m not freaking out.
CHANDLER: Why would I be freaking out?
CHANDLER: A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
MONICA: Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!
MONICA: I mean, what’s the harm in that?
CHANDLER: Right here!
MONICA: Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel
CHANDLER: Phoebe and Rachel!
CHANDLER: So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
MONICA: It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because it doesn’t.
CHANDLER: Okay.
MONICA: Really?
CHANDLER: Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know that I’m just not ready
MONICA: I know! I know.
CHANDLER: Okay.
MONICA: I’m gonna go tell Joey that  that you’re back. I was really worried about you.
PHOEBE: Hey, did she buy it?
CHANDLER: Totally.
PHOEBE: So did Heldi show you the place?
CHANDLER: Yeah, it’s beautiful.
PHOEBE: I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you!
CHANDLER: I know.
RACHEL: Okay look, I have an idea.
RACHEL: Why don’t we, why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him.
RACHEL: And then whoever does gets the phone.
RACHEL: All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
PHOEBE: Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
RACHEL: Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
PHOEBE: Did I use that already today? I’m sorry.
RACHEL: Joe.
RACHEL: Oh, I win! He’s got
PHOEBE: So you don’t know that’s
RACHEL: His new girlfriend!
MONICA: I can’t believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
CHANDLER: I don’t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.
CHANDLER: She’s saving the rest for her divorce.
CHANDLER: And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to
RACHEL: Well what happened at dinner?
MONICA: My parents spent the money for our wedding!
PHOEBE: My God! What did you order?!
RACHEL: Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
CHANDLER: Honey, it’s gonna be okay.
MONICA: No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
RACHEL: No, y’know what?
RACHEL: It’s gonna be okay.
RACHEL: I mean you don’t have to have this rustic Italian feast.
RACHEL: Y’know?
RACHEL: And-and you don’t need, you don’t need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
OLDER SCIENTIST: Dr. Geller, there’s a seat over here.
ROSS: Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I’m having my lunch at this table, here in the middle.
ROSS: I’m having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he’ll sit with me.
JOEY: I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
ROSS: Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch.
ROSS: Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y’know what I see, I see-I see division.
ROSS: Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!"
ROSS: Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.
ROSS: I’m Ross!
ROSS: I’m divorced, and I have a kid!
JOEY: I’m Joey! I’m an actor! I don’t know squat about dinosaurs!
ANOTHER TOUR GUIDE: I’m Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
ROSS: All right, there you go!
JOEY: Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
OLDER SCIENTIST: I’m Andrew, and I didn’t pay for this pear.
ROSS: Okay, good-good for you.
TOUR GUIDE: I’m Rhonda,  and these aren’t real!
ROSS: Wow, Rhonda.
ANOTHER SCIENTIST: I’m Scott.
ROSS: Yeah, okay, Scott!
ANOTHER SCIENTIST: And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.

DOUG: This team is about hard work, but it’s also about having fun.
DOUG: Good to have you aboard Bing!
PHOEBE: Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
CHANDLER: So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
PHOEBE: They're gonna call her Chandler.
CHANDLER: That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
PHOEBE: Works on you.
ROSS: Oh, that is so sweet.
ROSS: No, no, ok, you hang up.
ROSS: Ok, ok, one, two, three.
ROSS: Well you didn't hang up either.
RACHEL: She didn't hang up either...

ROSS: OK, I need to lie down.
JOEY: Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
ROSS: Really? That's great!
JOEY: I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her
CAROL: (noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of
JOEY: Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks,
ROSS: Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one.
ROSS: Ben is way cuter than that kid.
ROSS: I mean look at him, look at you,
JOEY: That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
ROSS: Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
JOEY: I look more like him than you do!
CAROL: Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
MONICA: That really was some of your best work.
CHANDLER: Hm-hmm, I told you!  I can’t believe that I’ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
MONICA: I have to be up in seven minutes.
CHANDLER: Well, you’re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes
MONICA: Really?!
CHANDLER: Do you wanna?
MONICA: Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I’ll get the furniture polish!
KRISTEN: Oh okay. But y’know what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
JOEY: Boyfriend?
KRISTEN: No.
JOEY: I’m Joey.
KRISTEN: Kristen.
JOEY: Oh wow, what a beautiful name!  What is it again?
KRISTEN: Kristen.
JOEY: Got it!  So
KRISTEN: So uh, do you live around here?
JOEY: Yeah!
JOEY: Yeah!
JOEY: Right down there.
JOEY: Hey listen.. let me give you a little tip.
JOEY: Do not take a nap on this stoop  or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
KRISTEN: I’ll remember that.
JOEY: Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
KRISTEN: Oh I, I have plans tonight.
KRISTEN: But how about tomorrow?
JOEY: Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go?
KRISTEN: You look strong, why don’t I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
JOEY: Okay. Yeah.  Yeah, I’ll grab this one.
PHOEBE: Hey.
PHOEBE: Listen, um...
PHOEBE: I'm sorry.
PHOEBE: : Yeah, um...  You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin'
PHOEBE: That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
PHOEBE: Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
PHOEBE: If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
PHOEBE: Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
PHOEBE: You know...  You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
ROSS: By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.
PHOEBE: Oh, hello liar.
ROSS: Look, I-I’m really sorry I let go of the bike.
PHOEBE: I could’ve been killed I hope you know!
ROSS: I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were
PHOEBE: Well, I would love to but…the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
ROSS: Phoebe.
PHOEBE: What?!  What the hell?!
ROSS: All right, y’know what?
ROSS: If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I’m sorry, I’m just gonna have to take it back.
PHOEBE: What?! Why?!
ROSS: Because! Because, it-it-it’s… It’d be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar
PHOEBE: All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
ROSS: Great! Great!  You’re making the bike very happy.
PHOEBE: Okay Ross!  Please don’t die!
MONA: How could you have kept all of this from me?
ROSS: I was going to tell you, but
DR. GREEN: But what?! You figured you’d get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!
ROSS: Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just…  Why don’t we just let the machine get that?
JOEY: Hey Ross. It’s Joey. There’s a hooker over here and we thought maybe you’d know something about it.
ROSS: No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I—I need to, I need to lie down.
JOEY: Everything on your application looks really good—Ohh!
JOEY: Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
THE POTENTIAL ROOMMATE: Oh don’t worry, I’m not really a party girl.
JOEY: Whoa!! Now look, don’t be just blurtin’ stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
CHANDLER: You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! I’ll be living here.
JOEY: Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don’t think he’s gonna get it.
CHANDLER: Why did you take the shower curtain down?
JOEY: That thing was a hazard!  I’m very safety conscious.
JOEY: Hi.
CHANDLER: Hey man, how did the audition go?
JOEY: Estelle said I didn't get it.
RACHEL: What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
JOEY: Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
ROSS: No!
ROSS: For all I know, she’s trying to find me but couldn’t because I kept moving around.
ROSS: No, from now on, I’m staying in one place.
ROSS: Right here.
MONICA: Well, it’s getting late.
CHANDLER: Yeah, we’re gonna go.
ROSS: Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
MONICA: Ugh, y’know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
CHANDLER: Yeah, it’s a very large plane.
ROSS: That’s cool.
CHANDLER: But, we’ll stay here with you.
ROSS: Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, y’know, but you don’t have to rub my butt.
PHOEBE: Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
ROSS: They’re not a couple!
PHOEBE: Oh-okay, I get the game now.
JOEY: Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
ROSS: Oh yeah!
JOEY: Well okay, so then you’re fine.
JOEY: The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.
JOEY: Okay?
JOEY: So as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.
JOEY: It’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble.
CHANDLER: Really?
JOEY: Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
ROSS: No.
JOEY: Noooo!!
PHOEBE: Ursula!  Wait! Err-err, it’s me! Phoebe!
URSULA: Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye.
PHOEBE: Wait a second! So, what’s new with you?
URSULA: Umm, nothing. I mean, I’m getting married next week.
JIM: And your breasts! Hmm!!!
PHOEBE: Okay.
PHOEBE: Umm look, you’re coming on a little strong.
PHOEBE: But I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together.
PHOEBE: So, why don’t we just start over okay?
PHOEBE: And you can just tell me about yourself.
JIM: All right.
PHOEBE: Okay.
JIM: I write erotic novels, for children.
PHOEBE: What?!
JIM: They’re wildly unpopular.
PHOEBE: Oh my God!
JIM: Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.
PHOEBE: Wow! You do?
JIM: Yeah,  a Pretty Huge
PHOEBE: All right.
ROSS: So, uh, how's she doing?
AUNT LILLIAN: The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
MONICA: How-how are you, Mom?
MRS. GELLER: Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
MONICA: What?
MRS. GELLER: What's different?
MONICA: Nothing.
MRS. GELLER: Oh, maybe that's it.
MONICA: She is unbelievable, our mother is...
ROSS: Okay, relax, relax.
ROSS: We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
MONICA: Oh God!
MONICA: The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
ROSS: Oh!
ROSS: ...Yeah, they were gross.
ROSS: Oh, you know what I loved?
ROSS: Her Sweet 'n' Los.
ROSS: How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
MR. GELLER: Not just restaurants, from our house.
RACHEL: Maybe.
MONICA: You can't!
RACHEL: Why?  Seriously I did not understand a word that    you said.
MONICA: In the hall.
RONNI: Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping.
RONNI: But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.
RONNI: Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
CHANDLER: Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
RONNI: That's a good one!
MR. TRIBBIANI: Hey, Joe.
JOEY: Dad, Ronni's here.
MR. TRIBBIANI: Huh?
RACHEL: So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there’s anything that you like, we can make you a deal.
RACHEL: Anything at all.
RACHEL: But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
CHANDLER: Well, thanks a lot for hookin’ me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
RACHEL: I’m Monica’s maid of honor. Okay? Don’t try to blue pin me!
ROSS: Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah.
MONICA: Limited seating my ass. Let’s see who made the cut.  Hi!
MONICA: I’m Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
MONICA: Used to work with her. Used to! I’m a relative and I didn’t get invited! A
ROSS: Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
MONICA: So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
MONICA: Okay, you’re fine.
EMILY: Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
MONICA: You’ll see.
EMILY: I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
ROSS: Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y’know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles
MONICA: And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and…  You go.
ROSS: But-but, if you don’t love this, we’ll do it in any other place at any other time.
ROSS: Really, it’s fine, whatever you want.
EMILY: It’s perfect.
ROSS: And, I don’t know, if it starts to rain
EMILY: Well then we’ll get wet.
MONICA: Ohh. And I don’t even have a date.
RACHEL: Coming.
ROSS: I have a bone to pick with you.
RACHEL: Uh-oh.
ROSS: Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
RACHEL: Oh yeah? Did he pull the old
ROSS: That’s right! That’s right!
RACHEL: Oh that.
ROSS: Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean and they’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them!
CECILIA: Y’know what? It doesn’t matter! Because it is not true!
JOEY: Okay.
CECILIA: And if it were true, how
JOEY: Ms. Monroe…  Oh there you go.
JOEY: Mark's a genius!
ROSS: Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
CHANDLER: Look, don't you see what's happening here.
CHANDLER: Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.
CHANDLER: Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
ROSS: What am I going to do?
CHANDLER: Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that.
CHANDLER: All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
ROSS: I don't know you guys.
CHANDLER: All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you.
CHANDLER: And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
JOEY: And before you know it, she's with him.
JOEY: And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'
JOEY: And he'll be all, 'Yes!'
JOEY: And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'
JOEY: And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.'
JOEY: And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
CHANDLER: He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
JOEY: This is what I’ve got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
ROSS: Great. Great.
JOEY: Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I’ve got you, me, and Chandler and I’m gonna invite Gunther ‘cause, well, we’ve been talking about this pretty loud.
GUNTHER: I’ll be there.
JOEY: Listen, I know this is your party, but I’d really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
ROSS: Yeah. Tell ya what, let’s not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
JOEY: Okay! We’ll need a six-pack of
CHANDLER: Hey guys, what are you doing?
CHANDLER: Hey, y’know what, if you’re gonna do that, if you’re gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.
CHANDLER: Oh, come on!
CHANDLER: Chandler’s funny, sophisticated, and he’s very loveable, once you get to know him.
JOEY: Oh well, hey, Joey’s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he’ll be there.
CHANDLER: Well, Chandler will be there for you too.
CHANDLER: I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he’ll be there.
CHANDLER: And he’ll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you’re really hot.
JOEY: What do ya say? What do ya say?
PHOEBE: Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names.
PHOEBE: But, all right, I don’t—maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk.
JOEY: I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to name my kid!
MRS. GELLER: What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
MR. GELLER: I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
MRS. GELLER: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
MONICA: What's that supposed to mean?
MRS. GELLER: Nothing! It's an expression.
MONICA: No it's not.
MR. GELLER: Don't listen to your mother.
MR. GELLER: You're independent, and you always have been!
MR. GELLER: Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!
MR. GELLER: And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
JOEY: PBS Telethon.
PHOEBE: Hi Joey.
JOEY: Hey Pheebs!
PHOEBE: I
JOEY: $200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what
PHOEBE: Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not
ROSS: What kind of problem?
JOEY: Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!
CHANDLER: Oh my God!
JOEY: Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
MONICA: Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
JOEY: I don't wanna give up the bag.
JOEY: I don't have to give up the bag!
JOEY: Do I Rach?
JOEY: Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
RACHEL: Honey wait, Joey, I’m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it
RACHEL: I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
JOEY: I can't believe I'm hearing this!
RACHEL: Wait a minute!
RACHEL: Wait a minute!
RACHEL: I'm not saying that you shouldn’t have a bag, I just—it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial.
CHANDLER: Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
HOTEL CLERK: I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
CHANDLER: Okay, great.
HOTEL CLERK: They say he's only got half a tank left.
CHANDLER: Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
MONICA: We're switching rooms again.
CHANDLER: What? Why?
MONICA: This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
HOTEL CLERK: Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
MONICA: Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
CHANDLER: Uh-huh.
MONICA: Chandler!
CHANDLER: Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
JOEY: Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
CHANDLER: Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
PHOEBE: Hey!
DAVID: Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn’t think you were coming.
PHOEBE: Oh, I wouldn’t miss this.
DAVID: Well, I’m very glad you’re here.
PHOEBE: Oh, you’re such a gentleman.  Come on! We’re going to my place!
JOEY: Hey!
MONICA: Hey-hey.
JOEY: So are guys doing okay?
CHANDLER: Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
TAG: Do you have a minute?
RACHEL: Well yeah, sure, what’s up?
TAG: I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch…by guys.
RACHEL: Oh really?!
TAG: Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
RACHEL: Oh, did you not want people to know that?
TAG: But I’m not gay. And I especially wouldn’t want you to think I was gay.
RACHEL: Why’s that?
TAG: I don’t think I should say.
RACHEL: Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don’t want you to feel like you can’t tell me things.
TAG: Okay.
RACHEL: ‘Kay.
TAG: Well
RACHEL: Yeah.
TAG: I’d love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
RACHEL: Yeah, she’s gay.
CASEY: Here you go.
JOEY: Great! All right, so I’ll call you later.
CASEY: Great!
CHANDLER: Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
JOEY: That would be Casey. We’re going out tonight.
CHANDLER: Goin’ out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didn’t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
JOEY: No, things are fine with Kathy. I’m having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
CHANDLER: What?
JOEY: Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
CHANDLER: Wait! You’re going out with Kathy!
JOEY: Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
CHANDLER: Well, I’m upset—for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
JOEY: What is the big deal? It’s not like we’re exclusive.
CHANDLER: Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.
CHANDLER: But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you.
JOEY: You got all that from the back of her head?
CHANDLER: All right look, I think it’s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
JOEY: Who’s Elaine?
CHANDLER: Can you people not see me?!
RACHEL: So, will you talk to him?
JOEY: I don’t know Rach.
RACHEL: Oh, come on! I’ll give you ten free
JOEY: One!  No ten! You said ten! You can’t take that back!
RACHEL: Hey!
CHANDLER: Hi!
CHANDLER: Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television?
CHANDLER: We need a porn break.
CHANDLER: We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
RACHEL: Well, so, why don’t you just turn it off?
CHANDLER: Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
PHOEBE: Ooh, good, you’re hear! Okay.
MONICA: Hey!
PHOEBE: Hi!
RACHEL: Well, what-what ‘cha got there?
PHOEBE: Oh this, well I’m glad you asked.
PHOEBE: Now, don’t you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?
PHOEBE: Ahh!
PHOEBE: Now, I know what you’re thinking
CHANDLER: Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
MONICA: Phoebe, they didn’t make you pay for those knives, did they?
PHOEBE: No!
RACHEL: Honey, you’re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
PHOEBE: No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
CHANDLER: What’s the second part of your plan?
ROSS: Yes that’s right.
THE INSTRUCTOR: Why?
ROSS: I tired attacking two women, did not work.
THE INSTRUCTOR: What?!
ROSS: No, I mean it’s okay, I mean, they’re-they’re my friends.
ROSS: In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
THE INSTRUCTOR: Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
ROSS: Oh, no!
ROSS: No-no!
ROSS: No, I tired!
ROSS: But I couldn’t.
ROSS: That’s why I’m here.
ROSS: Maybe we could attack them together?
ROSS: That-that’s a no.
ROSS: What? No! No, I’m not stopping. I’m Red Ross!
JOEY: Dude, if you go back out there, you’re gonna be Dead Ross!
ROSS: I don’t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
EMILY: All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
ROSS: No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
EMILY: No. That’s not what I’m saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
ROSS: I like that.
EMILY: Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
ROSS: Huh?
EMILY: One swift kick and he’ll back off.
ROSS: All right, bad ankle, got it!
EMILY: And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip.
EMILY: Yeah.
EMILY: And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn’t wear a cup.
ROSS: Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
EMILY: And uh, Liam, Liam’s got bad knees. You hit him right and he’ll go down like a lamp.
ROSS: But-but, Liam’s on my team.
EMILY: I don’t care! You just get him!
ROSS: I’m gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
JOEY: The Red Ross! Okay.
RACHEL: Oh!  Oh by the way?
PHOEBE: Uh-hmm.
RACHEL: James Brolin?
PHOEBE: Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he’s gay.
RACHEL: Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
PHOEBE: Really?!
RACHEL: Hello?
RUSSELL: Hello, is Ross there?
RACHEL: Uh no, he’s not. Can I take a message?
RUSSELL: Yes, this Russell, Ross’s divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven’t heard from him, I assume he’s decided to give the marriage a try.
RACHEL: Ross got married again—Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
RACHEL: Oh-oh! Okay, she’s kicking!
CHANDLER: Oh!  She’s growing inside you.
RACHEL: Whoa!!
CHANDLER: Oh!
RACHEL: Wow that was a big one.
CHANDLER: I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.
PHOEBE: Oh hey you guys!
JOEY: Sure, I can hang out ‘til I have to meet ya.  What uh—How come you’re not going?
CHANDLER: I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
JOEY: I thought you already have a job.
CHANDLER: And people say you don’t pay attention.
CHANDLER: No, this is a much better job.
CHANDLER: It’s vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
JOEY: Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
CHANDLER: That’s what I do now.
MONICA: Hey Joey, come taste this.
JOEY: What is it?
MONICA: Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well…  I’m getting my revenge!
JOEY: You cooked him?
MONICA: No.
MONICA: He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again.
MONICA: Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow!
MONICA: "Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."
CHANDLER: The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don’t ya?
JOEY: So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
CHANDLER: No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
MONICA: We’re never gonna find anybody.
JOEY: Well then let me do it!
CHANDLER: Joe
JOEY: No-no-no!
JOEY: Look, I’ve been thinking about it.
JOEY: I’m an actor right?
JOEY: So I won’t get nervous talking in front of people.
JOEY: I won’t spit, and I won’t stare at Monica’s breasts!
JOEY: Everyone knows I’m an ass man!
MONICA: That is true.
JOEY: Yeah and the most important thing is that it won’t be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you.
JOEY: It’ll be me!
JOEY: And I swear I’ll do a really good job.
JOEY: Plus, y’know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
MONICA: It might be kinda cool.
JOEY: So I can do it?
PHOEBE: Ah-ha! Too cocky!
JOEY: I still can’t believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
PHOEBE: Of course I do! And I’m gonna give it back to you as soon as they’re done with it at the key shining place.
JOEY: What the hell is that?
JOEY: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
MR. TREEGER: You said there was a gas leak in here.
PHOEBE: Well why don’t you use your key?
MR. TREEGER: Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded.
MR. TREEGER: If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions.
MR. TREEGER: Come on!
MR. TREEGER: Hurry up.
PHOEBE: Oh! We could have done that.
CHANDLER: Luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re talking about.
PHOEBE: Oh, I’m so sorry.
PHOEBE: Um, and maybe I’m wrong!
PHOEBE: I but—y’know I’m gonna go out with him again, I’ll find out more.
CHANDLER: You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’re still gonna date him?
PHOEBE: Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl’s gotta eat.
MONICA: Oh, but it’s made her so happy.
ROSS: Little girl misses her cat.
ROSS: Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.
ROSS: Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
ALL: Yeah.
ROSS: Thank you.
RACHEL: I
MONICA: He is right, isn’t he?
CHANDLER: Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he’s wrong.
ALL: You think?
CHANDLER: Oh-no, he’s right.
JOEY: Seven hundred bucks!
CHANDLER: Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
JOEY: Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
CHANDLER: Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
JOEY: What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
PHOEBE: Oh.
MONICA: Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
PHOEBE: Me too.
PHOEBE: Although this city is my home, so.
PHOEBE: So that’s dumb what I said, don’t tell him I said that.
PHOEBE: Umm, you make something up.
PHOEBE: Nice,  thank you.
PHOEBE: This is me.
PHOEBE: Here.
MISCHA: Your eyes are very pretty.
PHOEBE: Thank you, very much! Oh!  Thank you!
MISCHA: He would like to kiss you.
PHOEBE: Okay, y'know what, you don’t have to do that now.
PHOEBE: No-no-no-no!!
PHOEBE: Not him, you don’t!
PHOEBE: Well the moment’s over.
PHOEBE: Oh.
MISCHA: Oy!
CHANDLER: Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
JOEY: I’d really prefer a mountain bike.
CHANDLER: Janice’s birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
JOEY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa.
JOEY: Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
CHANDLER: That’s a good idea, ‘Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday’. I would like to get her something serious.
JOEY: Oh, you want something serious.
JOEY: Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas.
JOEY: Those are dead serious.
CHANDLER: All right. Look, I’m gonna go in here, and you don’t buy me anything ever.
JOEY: No, no, you can’t, you can’t, okay, you can’t, you can’t buy her pearls, you just can’t, you can’t, you can’t.
CHANDLER: Why not?!
JOEY: Oh God. Uh, okay, here’s the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
CHANDLER: What is the thing?
JOEY: Okay. I went down to the ‘Mattress King’ showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
CHANDLER: What?
JOEY: They were in his office.
CHANDLER: Well she, she wouldn’t do that, she’s with, she’s with me.
RACHEL: I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
ROSS: You’re drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I’m a little drunk.
JOEY: Hey! Are those crab cakes?  Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
CHANDLER: How are you feeling?
MONICA: You are
ROSS: I really wish that you wouldn’t.
CHANDLER: Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay?
CHANDLER: Then we can put you in bed, okay?
CHANDLER: Just smile and don’t talk to
PHOEBE: Speech! Speech! Let’s hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
CHANDLER: Pheebs!!
PHOEBE: Don’t you see? Everyone’s looking at me! The plan’s working! I didn’t even have to take off my top yet!
MRS. GELLER: Speech! Come on Monica!
ROSS: Come on!
ALL: Come on! Speech!
MR. GELLER: Hey Chandler, you can’t keep your hands off her for one second!
MRS. GELLER: Oh-ho, I think it’s nice.
RACHEL: Well you have to because maybe it’s stupid.
CHANDLER: Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
MONICA: Oh crap!
MONICA: All right.
MONICA: The super couldn’t figure out what it did.
MONICA: A $200 an hour electrician couldn’t figure out what it did.
MONICA: I’ve had seven pretty serious shocks.
MONICA: I officially give up.
RACHEL: Thank God.
MONICA: I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
PHOEBE: See? I’m doing it. I am totally doing it.  I lost it.
CHANDLER: Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
MONICA: He doesn't have anyone.
PHOEBE: Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
JOEY: I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
RACHEL: Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
JAY LENO: Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.
JAY LENO: You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
CHANDLER: Y'know, we don't have to watch this.
RACHEL: No way, forget it.
JOEY: C'mon, she's your mom!
CHANDLER: Exactly.
RACHEL: Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books!
RACHEL: I love her books!
RACHEL: I cannot get on a plane without one!
RACHEL: I mean, this is so cool!
CHANDLER: Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
ROSS: C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
JOEY: Thank you.
RACHEL: And a nice hot cider for Monica.
MONICA: Aww, thank you.  Uh Rach?
RACHEL: Yeah?
MONICA: Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
RACHEL: Oh! That's why.  I'm sorry!
PHOEBE: Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
PHOEBE: You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
THE SMOKING WOMAN: Yeah I can, it worked real well.
PHOEBE: No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
THE SMOKING WOMAN: I won't!  Until I have my next cigarette.
PHOEBE: Hold it!  N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
THE SMOKING WOMAN: What?!
PHOEBE: Yeah that's right you are so busted.  Book 'em.
THE SMOKING WOMAN: Who are you talking too?
PHOEBE: Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
THE SMOKING WOMAN: I am
PHOEBE: You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup.   Backup! Backup!!
THE SMOKING WOMAN: I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
PHOEBE: Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
PHOEBE: Shh! Get me out of here.
RACHEL: Oh.
JOEY: Ross!
ROSS: What?
JOEY: Come here, check this out!
ROSS: What? Is it the comet?
JOEY: No! No-no. Look, there’s a bug stuck in tar right here.
ROSS: Joey come—I can’t believe—I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature’s most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
JOEY: Y’know, there’s
ROSS: Show me where?
JOEY: Right-right up here.
ROSS: Joey where’s the pipe that was holding the door open?
JOEY: I don’t know!   Yeah, I do.
ROSS: Joey!
JOEY: What?! All right—Hey! Don’t look at me! You’re the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid
ROSS: It’s called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
JOEY: Oh no! No! No!
PHOEBE: Wow! This place is incredible!  Sting’s pen…that he gave to Phoebe.  Come on! Secret passageway!
TRUDIE STYLER: Hi!
PHOEBE: Hi!
TRUDIE STYLER: I’m Trudie.
PHOEBE: Uh-huh.
TRUDIE STYLER: You must be Ben’s mum.
PHOEBE: Why else would I be here?
TRUDIE STYLER: Do sit down.
RACHEL: Yeah.
MONICA: Hi.. how was the game?
ROSS: Well..
ALL: WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
MONICA: Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
JOEY: Alan.
ROSS: He was unbelievable.
ROSS: He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
RACHEL: I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
CHANDLER: Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
MONICA: Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
ROSS: What?
MONICA: ..I dunno, a little too Alan?
RACHEL: Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
ROSS: Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
CHANDLER: I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
JOEY: Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that’s the first A I’ve gotten since seventh grade,
MONICA: Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
JOEY: What the hell!
MONICA: Okay.
THE ACTING TEACHER: All right, let’s start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?
JOEY: Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
ROSS: My God!
ROSS: These pants are burning up!
ROSS: Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!
ROSS: What is she trying to kill me?
ROSS: It's like a volcano in here!
ROSS: Are you hot?
ROSS: Okay, it must just be me then.
ROSS: That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
JOEY: You're driving me crazy with that!
CHANDLER: Okay, I'll stop.
JOEY: Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
JOEY: Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
CHANDLER: You wanna play?
JOEY: Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon.
JOEY: And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
CHANDLER: Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
JOEY: All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
CHANDLER: I'm intrigued.
JOEY: All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
CHANDLER: Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
JOEY: Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
CHANDLER: Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
JOEY: Uh yeah, right here.
MONICA: Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
RACHEL: What's that?
MONICA: Weeeell, it's rum, and-
MONICA: I'm sure they'll be here soon.
RACHEL: Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
JOEY: Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
CHANDLER: You are really frightening me.
CHANDLER: Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?
DR. FRANZBLAU: All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
NURSE: All right, honey, time to start pushing.
CAROL: But they're not here yet!
DR. FRANZBLAU: I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
CAROL: Oh, god.
ROSS: Here we go. Mona umm, I think it’s time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.
MONA: Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.
ROSS: Aw, we-we are so… So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y’know hanging out with you.
ROSS: And I mean-I’m having a lot of fun.
MONA: Okay.
ROSS: I mean, there’s no point in spending time with someone if-if it’s just fun.
ROSS: It’s gotta be, it’s gotta be going somewhere right?
ROSS: So where-where is it going?
ROSS: Ah!
ROSS: That’s-that’s the real question.
ROSS: And-and the answer is…is it’s going somewhere…fun.
ROSS: Now I-I know what you’re thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know, but you’re-you’re not getting any younger.
ROSS: No I mean—No not you, not you, you—you
MONA: I’m sorry, so umm, so where are we?
CHANDLER: Y’know what?
CHANDLER: I am going to take you out to dinner tonight.
CHANDLER: I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .
CHANDLER: No?
CHANDLER: Really?
CHANDLER: They taste so good.
PHOEBE: Drum roll.
CHANDLER: Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
JOEY: Nah, you’re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
CHANDLER: All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
PHOEBE: You’re actually going through with this?
CHANDLER: Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.
CHANDLER: Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
PHOEBE: You got problems because of you!
PHOEBE: Not your name!
PHOEBE: All right, this has got to stop!
PHOEBE: Chandler is a great name!
PHOEBE: In fact—yes,  I’m, I’m sorry.
PHOEBE: I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’m-I’m, I’m gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler.
ROSS: Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
EMILY: It was.
STUDENT: Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that’s not gonna be me, not me.
JOEY: Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
STUDENT: No.
JOEY: Whoa. That was really good.
STUDENT: Thanks, any suggestions?
PHOEBE: You-you…you had sex with Ursula?!
ERIC: Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and
PHOEBE: You didn’t notice she was wearing different clothes?!
ERIC: Well I was just so excited to see you.
PHOEBE: Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y’know what? This is too weird.
ERIC: No-no it’s not!
ERIC: I don’t want to lose you!
ERIC: It’s-it’s like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you—Yeah it is too weird.
PHOEBE: So I guess this is it.
ERIC: Yeah.  Maybe it’s for the best. You smell just like her.
PHOEBE: Yeah, so do you.
PHOEBE: Hey!
RACHEL: Hi.
PHOEBE: So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
RACHEL: Manhattan does not have enough stores.
PHOEBE: Well,
RACHEL: You can?
PHOEBE: Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
RACHEL: Um-hmm.
PHOEBE: And a small piece of chocolate.
RACHEL: Okay.
CHANDLER: Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship
JANICE: I know! And I’m just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
CHANDLER: Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
JANICE: Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
CHANDLER: I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
JANICE: Oh no! Where to?  Too Paris?
CHANDLER: No! No! Not, Paris.
JANICE: Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?
CHANDLER: Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. That’s right, yes, I’m being transferred to Yemen!
JANICE: When?
CHANDLER: I don’t know exactly.
JANICE: Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
CHANDLER: But I do know that it’s some time tomorrow.
PHOEBE: Ooh, this is it!  Oh, that’s him! That’s him!
JOEY: Great! Go get him.
PHOEBE: Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
JOEY: He’s not really my type.
PHOEBE: No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what’s he like. People tell doctors everything.
PHOEBE: But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
JOEY: You do attract some stinkers.
WOMAN: Chandler.
CHANDLER: Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a
MRS. TEDLOCK: Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
CHANDLER: Oh, listen.
CHANDLER: If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them.
CHANDLER: Really.
CHANDLER: Nothing at all.
CHANDLER: Really.
CHANDLER: Nothing.
CHANDLER: Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
MONICA: Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?
CHANDLER: No. When it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict.
MONICA: Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out?
CHANDLER: No, no, I keep trying, y’know?
CHANDLER: I can get out, "Joey, I have too…" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "…go to the bathroom."
CHANDLER: He may think I’m sick.
MONICA: Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have to get it over with!
MONICA: Y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them.
MONICA: That’s it.
CHANDLER: Oh, so that’s this is gonna work now? You’re just gonna order me around all the time?
MONICA: Pretty much.
CHANDLER: All right.
JOEY: Hey Monica!
MONICA: Hi!
JOEY: Hey man, you feeling any better?
MONICA: Joey, we have something to tell you.
JOEY: Oh my God! You’re pregnant!
PHOEBE: Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you’re only married in Vegas.
MONICA: What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you’re married everywhere.
PHOEBE: Really?!
MONICA: Yeah!
PHOEBE: Oh my God!—Eh! Well
MONICA: You see that guy? He’s in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he’s going straight to the porn.
RICHARD: He’s gonna go up to the counter with
MONICA: Yeah.
RICHARD: I missed this.
MONICA: Me too.
RICHARD: So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
THE GUYS: Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
PHOEBE: Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
THE GUYS: We will.
MONICA: Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
RACHEL: No Mon,
MONICA: Every year.
PHOEBE: Hey! Ross!
CHANDLER: Die Hard
JOEY: Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
CHANDLER: What’d you rent?
JOEY: Die Hard 2
CHANDLER: Joey, this is
JOEY: Oh, well we watch it a second time and its
ROSS: Joey, we
JOEY: And?
ROSS: And it’ll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
ROSS: Die Hard
ROSS: Dude, you didn’t say
CHANDLER: Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
ROSS: Well, John McClane had plans!
CHANDLER: No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
JOEY: What are you talking about? Bitch.
JOEY/DRAKE: I know you botched that operation on purpose.
JOEY/DRAKE: I can't prove    it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder.
JOEY/DRAKE: I don't care if you    are my brother.
PHOEBE: Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium    in the Devonian era was top notch!
ROSS: Stop going through my stuff !
RACHEL: Hey!
MONICA: Hey!
RACHEL: I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna    do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.
MONICA: No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
RACHEL: Please, what about you and Chandler?
MONICA: That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
RACHEL: Well hello !
MONICA: What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them?
RACHEL: I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
MONICA: Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
RACHEL: I'm gonna do it.
MONICA: And I can't stop you.
RACHEL: No.
ROSS: Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
ROSS: I'm smarter than
ROSS: Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
GUNTHER: Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
JOEY: Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘cause I’m heading up there.
ROSS: Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.
JOEY: Sure.  Coffee? ‘Cause I’m going up there.
RACHEL: No.
MONICA: No, thank you.
JOEY: You guys need anything, ‘cause I’m heading up there.
WOMAN: I’d love an ice water.
JOEY: You got it.
MONICA: Joey, what are you doing?
JOEY: Just being friendly.
RACHEL: Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.
JOEY: Nah, it’s okay. Right, Gunther?
GUNTHER: Don’t wink at me. And put on your apron.
JOEY: Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
MONICA: Joey, do you work here?
JOEY: No.
CUSTOMER: Hey, waiter.
JOEY: Yeah?
CHANDLER: You’ve reached Monica and Chandler’s, if you’re listening to this message, we’re probably screening.  Yeah we are.
THE MUSEUM OFFICIAL: Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum.
THE MUSEUM OFFICIAL: I’m calling for Monica Geller.
THE MUSEUM OFFICIAL: I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she’s still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
CHANDLER: This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes, the groom—No! Not the groom!!
MONICA: Thank you.
PHOEBE: Thanks.
MONICA: I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
PHOEBE: Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am
MONICA: This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
PHOEBE: So go fix it!
PHOEBE: Go find Chandler!
PHOEBE: He's probably up in your room!
PHOEBE: Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
MONICA: Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
PHOEBE: Sure!   Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
MONICA: Anybody lose this?
THE CROUPIER: Comin' out. Place your bet.  Dice are out.  Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
MONICA: Hmm.
RACHEL: Do you remember where the duck food is?
PHOEBE: Yeah, it’s in the guys’ apartment under the sink. Why?
RACHEL: Because I’m going to London.
PHOEBE: What?! What do you mean you’re going to London?
RACHEL: Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him.
RACHEL: Now honey, you take care, you don’t have those babies until I get back.
PHOEBE: I—Rachel, you can’t go! Ross loves Emily!
RACHEL: Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does.
RACHEL: But I have to tell him how I feel!
RACHEL: He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
PHOEBE: That’s not why you’re going!
PHOEBE: You’re going because you hope he’s gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach.
PHOEBE: Forget that British chippy."
RACHEL: Ohh—Do you think he will?!
PHOEBE: No!
PHOEBE: Because he’s in love with the British chippy!
PHOEBE: Look, Rachel, if you go, you’re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!
PHOEBE: Y’know, it’s too late!
PHOEBE: You missed you’re chance!
PHOEBE: I’m sorry, I know this must be really hard, it’s over.
RACHEL: Y’know what? No. It’s not over until someone says, "I do."
PHOEBE: I do! I do! I do!  I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. I’m carrying a litter.
ROSS: So is everybody here?
ROSS: I got here a little early myself.
ROSS: Let us begin.
ROSS: Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations.
ROSS: Here.
ROSS: Here.
ROSS: Now as for the hydrosaurs
JOEY: Well, so anyway Beth, what I’m saying is I should’ve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night.
JOEY: I’ve ah, I’ve recently learned what’s it like to be on your side of it, and I’m sorry.
JOEY: So, do you think you can forgive me?
JOEY: Great.
JOEY: Thanks.
JOEY: Okay, bye.
JOEY: Hello, Jennifer?
JOEY: Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there?
JOEY: Oh, she’s not home huh?
JOEY: Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
PHOEBE: Hey!
RACHEL: Hi.
PHOEBE: Are you all right?
RACHEL: Uhh… I think I just got engaged.
PHOEBE: Oh my God! He did it?
RACHEL: Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?
PHOEBE: Are you kidding?
PHOEBE: I’m like the one who talked him into it.
PHOEBE: I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
RACHEL: And you really think this is a good idea?
PHOEBE: I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too.  The puppet master gets tired people.
RACHEL: I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.
PHOEBE: Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks  so.
RACHEL: Really?! Even Ross?
PHOEBE: Especially Ross!
JOEY: Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’ll come  back later.
ROSS: Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guess just…I’ll  come back.
PHOEBE: There he goes, your fiancée.
RACHEL: I guess so.
PHOEBE: Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
RACHEL: I can’t say that I’m surprised.
PHOEBE: Oh, that is so unfortunate.
ROSS: What?
PHOEBE: Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
MONICA: Okay, I’ll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I’m sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
PHOEBE: You didn’t leave lipstick marks on the phone.
MONICA: Oh, then it must’ve been you. Bye.
PHOEBE: Bye-bye!  That’s why I moved out.
ROSS: Hey, y'know while we’re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don’t live here anymore.
PHOEBE: I think on some levels she already knows.
JEANNINE: Night Mon. Night Julio.
JULIO: Adiós.
MONICA: Look Julio, someone left their book here.
JULIO: Ah actually, that is mine.
MONICA: Oh yeah, what are you reading?
JULIO: Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
MONICA: Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it?
JULIO: I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
MONICA: Your a poet and don't know it.
JULIO: Actually I ah, I am a poet.
MONICA: Oh, then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about?
JULIO: Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
MONICA: Mine?  Right here?
JULIO: I can write an epic poem about this lip.
MONICA: How would that go?  Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
THE CONDUCTOR: Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
ROSS: What?
WOMAN ON TRAIN: I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
ROSS: What?
WOMAN ON TRAIN: We’re at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
ROSS: Are we really in Montreal?!
WOMAN ON TRAIN: Yes we are. So, coffee?
ROSS: Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
WOMAN ON TRAIN: Oh, no. But it’s just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
MONICA: Okay, here’s batch 22.
MONICA: Oh, maybe these’ll taste a little like your grandmother’s.
MONICA: This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
ROSS: Let’s give it a shot.
PHOEBE: Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
MONICA: No, just a Friday night.
PHOEBE: Would she?
JOEY: Would she?  You ate my candy bar!
RACHEL: Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
MONICA: I know honey, I’m sorry.
RACHEL: Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely related to the field they’re interested in.
MONICA: Gee, I don’t know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
RACHEL: Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t....
RACHEL: I don’t mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
RACHEL: Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
GUY: I’m sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....
RACHEL: It’s not funny, this is actually my job.
GUY: Oh believe me, I-I-I’ve been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
RACHEL: Oh well then, so I’m just going to go back to talking to my friend here.
RACHEL: And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
GUY: Ah, just one other thing.
RACHEL: Yes?!
GUY: I ah, I work at
RACHEL: Do you want my pickle?
PHOEBE: Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
MONICA: Why?
PHOEBE: Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
MONICA: Oh my God.
MONICA: Phoebe.
MONICA: Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
PHOEBE: Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.
MONICA: He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
PHOEBE: We should do something. Whistle.
MONICA: We are not going to whistle.
PHOEBE: Come on, do it.
MONICA: No!
PHOEBE: Do it!
MONICA: No!
PHOEBE: Do it do it do it!
MONICA: Woo-woo!
PHOEBE: I can't believe you did that!
MONICA: Hi! Umm, I’m Monica Geller, I’m the chef at Alessandro’s.
THE FOOD CRITIC: Still?
MONICA: I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
THE FOOD CRITIC: I don’t see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
JOEY: Either eat it, or be in it.
MONICA: Spoon?  So, what do you think?
THE FOOD CRITIC: I’m torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal.
JOEY: Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here.. there’s a new class comin’ in.
THE COOKING TEACHER: Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?
MONICA: I can.
THE COOKING TEACHER: Okay, go ahead.
MONICA: Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.
THE COOKING TEACHER: That’s very good, what’s your name?
MONICA: Monica.
THE COOKING TEACHER: Monica, you go to the head of the class.
MONICA: Okay.
PHOEBE: And there's a country called Argentinaaaa,    it's a place I've never seeeeen.
PHOEBE: But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a    human spleen.
PHOEBE: Human spleeeen.
PHOEBE: Olé!
MONICA: What are you doing here!
PHOEBE: Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street,    so I am here to entertain!
MONICA: Great!
PHOEBE: Yeah!
PHOEBE: It really has been great too, you know, some of this people    must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs!
PHOEBE: Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home".
MONICA: Listen Phoebe...
PHOEBE: Yeah.
MONICA: You know how much I love listening to your music, you know,    but...
PHOEBE: But what?
MONICA: This is kind of a classy place.
PHOEBE: Ok, say no more.
JOEY: I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
RACHEL: Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
JOEY: Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
JOEY: Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
WAITER: I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention
JOEY: Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
RACHEL: We can't. We're not pharmacists!
JOEY: I know we're not, but  Frank Medeio and...  Eva Trorro... womba...
RACHEL: Kate Miller?
JOEY: Kate Miller it is.
RACHEL: And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
JOEY: In that case should I make sure it's on real good?
RACHEL: Thank you.
CHANDLER: Oh my God!
MONICA: We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
ROSS: This year was supposed to be great!
ROSS: But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
ALL: No. No, you're not a loser.
ROSS: Look at me!
MONICA: Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
ROSS: Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
MONICA: See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
RACHEL: That really is something.. that's really cool.
JOEY: Howdy partner!
ROSS: Maybe I should get another pair!
ROSS: Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides.
ROSS: I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight.
ROSS: I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
ROSS: I would make a good cowboy.
MONICA: Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
CHANDLER: Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty.  Yep.
ROSS: No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
CHANDLER: Oh yeah!
JOEY: Great nap.
ROSS: It really was.
JOEY: Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.
THE INTERVIEWER: So, let’s talk about women. I’m sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life.
JOEY: Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin’?"
PHOEBE: Oh, please!
JOEY: Hey, how you doin’?
PHOEBE: Hey Mikey
MIKE: Hey P
PHOEBE: What are you doing?
MIKE: Setting rattraps
PHOEBE: To kill Bob??
MIKE: No, no, to test his neck strength.
PHOEBE: No, Mike, I don't want to kill him!
PHOEBE: I thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
MIKE: Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.
PHOEBE: I'll find Bob, I'll get him.
PHOEBE: Bob?
PHOEBE: Bob!
PHOEBE: Robert!
PHOEBE: Oh wait, I think I hear him.
PHOEBE: Oh - Oh my god!
PHOEBE: Bob    had babies!
PHOEBE: Bob's a mom!
MIKE: Better think of a new name for him.
PHOEBE: I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.
MIKE: I don't know, I mean I'm not sure  ...
PHOEBE: Oh my god, we killed Bob!
MIKE: Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
PHOEBE: Suzie
JOEY: Hmmm, soup!
CAROL: Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
JOEY: Oh yeah, no problem.
CAROL: Thanks.
JOEY: Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection.
ROSS: Joey!
MONICA: What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
RACHEL: Yeah, but he waited until the last minute!
RACHEL: So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party.
RACHEL: I said, "No!"
RACHEL: Which puts
MONICA: Great. So the ball is in his court?
RACHEL: Ball? There is no ball.
DANNY: Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?

DANNY: Oh great! That
DANNY: Do-do you, do you have brothers?
RACHEL: No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
DANNY: Are you close with them?
RACHEL: No-no, they're not very nice people.
DANNY: Okay, listen, I really like you.
DANNY: Okay?
DANNY: I think this can go somewhere.
DANNY: So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
RACHEL: Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of
KRISTA: Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
DANNY: What?
RACHEL: Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
ROSS: It’s over.
RACHEL: Oh, was it awful?
ROSS: Well, it was loong.
ROSS: I didn’t even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o’clock shadow on her head.
ROSS: Anyway, she didn’t want to stay.
ROSS: I called a cab. she just left.
RACHEL: I wrote you a letter.
ROSS: Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
RACHEL: It’s just some things I’ve been thinking about.
RACHEL: Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
ROSS: Okay.  Wow, it’s-it’s 5:30 in the morning.  So, I’d better get cracking on this baby.
RACHEL: Well, I’ll be waiting for you, just come up when you’re done.
ROSS: Okay, I’ll be up in,  18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
MONICA: The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
ALLESANDRO: Well, you said that we except the
MONICA: All right, that I’ll retract.
MONICA: But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn’t it.
MONICA: You’re marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice!
MONICA: You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
ALLESANDRO: Hey! I’m proud of that sauce, it’s delicious.
MONICA: Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
ALLESANDRO: Lebanon.
MONICA: Hand me those tomatoes, I’m gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
ALLESANDRO: How long is this gonna take? ‘Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
PHOEBE: Okay, then what happened?
PHOEBE: Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  You'll get your turn!
ROSS: Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
PHOEBE: Nothing!   This is not over!
ROSS: No! No! No!
PHOEBE: What?!
ROSS: I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in…  Actually, thanks!
JOEY: All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
ROSS: Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
JOEY: Really?
ROSS: Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
JOEY: Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
ROSS: That's okay, Joe.
JOEY: All right, let's go Pheebs.
ROSS: Oh God!
CHANDLER: That was amazing.
MONICA: I know.
MONICA: Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever?
MONICA: We may have just started a family.
MONICA: Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.
CHANDLER: And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
CHANDLER: Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!
ROSS: I knew it!
ROSS: I knew it!
ROSS: I always knew she liked him!
ROSS: Y'know, she’d say no, but here we are!
ROSS: Right?
ROSS: We just broke up, first thing she does!
CHANDLER: You didn’t just break up.
ROSS: Hey, it’s been like three weeks!
CHANDLER: You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
ROSS: Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
RACHEL: Oh yeah!
ROSS: Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily.
ROSS: Well, there's this one thing… Okay,  here goes.
ROSS: I made a promise that--Oh hey!
RACHEL: What?
ROSS: You're nose is bleeding!
RACHEL: Oh God.
RACHEL: No!
RACHEL: Oh not again!
RACHEL: This-this happened when my grandfather died.
RACHEL: It's ugh!
RACHEL: Sorry.
RACHEL: Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
ROSS: Umm
RACHEL: Sorry. Sorry.
ROSS: Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
RACHEL: Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
MONICA: Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
RACHEL: Hello, Chip.
CHIP: Hey, Rach! How ya doin’?
RACHEL: I’m great! I’m great. I’ve got a great job at
CHIP: So ah, Monica ready yet?
RACHEL: She’ll be out in a second. So, Chip, how’s umm, Amy Welch?
CHIP: Amy Welch? Wow! I haven’t seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
ROSS: That’s right, I love you! And-and I’m gonna play with you all the time.
PHOEBE: How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
RACHEL: He’s talking to the baby.
PHOEBE: Ohh!
PHOEBE: Okay!
PHOEBE: Okay, cause when-when he said, "I can’t wait to hear your first words," I thought, "There’s a trick."
RACHEL: Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I’ll see you later.
PHOEBE: Okay.
JOEY: Oh my, oh my God!
RACHEL: Aw, it’s unbelievable!
RACHEL: Wow!
RACHEL: She is kicking so much!
RACHEL: Oh, she’s like umm…oh…who’s that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
JOEY: Mia Hamm?
RACHEL: Mia Hamm!
JOEY: Oh that’s amazing.
RACHEL: Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
JOEY: Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
CHANDLER: Okay, what do you guys think?
ROSS: Dude!
JOEY: I have never known love like this.
CHANDLER: You really like it?
ROSS: Dude! How-how did you write this?
CHANDLER: I stole Monica’s and changed the name.
ROSS: You can’t
JOEY: If he goes first he can!
ROSS: Yeah!
ROSS: Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y’know?
ROSS: Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
JOEY: Oh wow that’s a great idea! And
GUNTHER: Here you go.
JOEY: Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one.
JOEY: Here you go.
JOEY: Y’know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just—I don’t get Chandler.
JOEY: Y’know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don’t get all upset.
ROSS: All the time?
JOEY: All the time!
ROSS: Cassie, how you-how you doin’ on that…hot dog.
CASSIE: I’m all done.
ROSS: Thank God.
CASSIE: I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
ROSS: Oh right.
ROSS: Right.
ROSS: Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you ‘til you cried?
ROSS: We’re probably too old to do that now.
CASSIE: I’ll always remember that summer, because it’s when I got all of these freckles.
ROSS: Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I’ll always remember that summer because that’s when I realized that we are related.
CASSIE: It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
ROSS: Well I’m, I’m a little slow.  Just as our children would be.
PHOEBE: Relax every muscle in your body.
PHOEBE: Listen to the plinky-plunky music.
PHOEBE: Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place.
PHOEBE: Okay, tell me your happy place.
MONICA: Richard's living room, drinking wine.
PHOEBE: All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
MONICA: I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
PHOEBE: Well, okay, fine, use my happy place.
PHOEBE: Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
MONICA: All right, I'll try not to.
PHOEBE: Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
MONICA: Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
PHOEBE: All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
MONICA: I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
PHOEBE: All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place.
PHOEBE: Okay.
PHOEBE: Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains.
PHOEBE: And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
MONICA: Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
ROSS: OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
JULIE: See you later Rach.
RACHEL: Bye-bye Julie.
RACHEL: Hey.
ROSS: Hey.
RACHEL: Hey, c'mon, cut it out.
ROSS: Hey?
RACHEL: What?
ROSS: Can I ask you somethin'?
PHOEBE: Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
RACHEL: Ok.
TERRY: Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?
RACHEL: What's up?
TERRY: F.Y.I..
TERRY: I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons.
TERRY: Her name is Stephanie... something.
TERRY: She's supposed to be very good.
RACHEL: But what about Phoebe?
TERRY: Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
RACHEL: Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
TERRY: Uh...
RACHEL: Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
ROSS: Ahh, no.
RACHEL: Oh.
ROSS: Are you jealous?
RACHEL: Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all.
RACHEL: I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
ROSS: You are totally jealous.
RACHEL: I'm not jealous.
RACHEL: All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers.
RACHEL: And y'know, and um, I...
ROSS: Honey, I love you too.
RACHEL: Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
ROSS: What?
ROSS: Huh.
RACHEL: Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
CHANDLER: Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
CHANDLER: I can’t believe you came back.
RACHEL: Don’t say anything.
RACHEL: I don’t wanna speak, I don’t wanna think.
RACHEL: I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
FRIEND NO. 2: Rachel! Rachel!
RACHEL: What?
FRIEND NO. 2: You missed the exit!
RACHEL: Oh, sorry.
FRIEND NO. 1: My God, what were you thinking about?
RACHEL: Um,  Barry.
HER-FRIENDS: Awwwww
PHOEBE: I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
JOEY: Dude!
CHANDLER: And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing.
PHOEBE: God!
JOEY: All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
MONICA: Well actually, Ross doesn't.
CHANDLER: Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
ROSS: Dear Mary-Angela.
ROSS: Hi.
ROSS: How?s it going.
ROSS: This is the hardest letter I?ve ever had to write.
ROSS: What the hell?s a matter with you?
ROSS: How do you think Joey?s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
CHANDLER: Well, that?s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I?ll be in Cuba.
ROSS: All right, look, look, you?ve got to do this yourself, okay in person.
ROSS: At least you know her name.
ROSS: You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
CHANDLER: What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
ROSS: Where in Cuba?
CHANDLER: Hey.
ROSS: You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
RACHEL: Oh! I knew it! What happened?
ROSS: Umm, she kissed me.
RACHEL: What?! You kissed!
JOEY: All right.
CHANDLER: Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have?
JOEY: A two and a five.
CHANDLER: Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
JOEY: Really?!
CHANDLER: Oh yeah! Okay, let’s play again.  What do you got?
JOEY: A four and a nine.
CHANDLER: You’re kidding right?
JOEY: No. Why?
CHANDLER: Well that’s a full cup!
JOEY: Damn! I am good at Cups!
RACHEL: What? Why? Where are you?
JOEY: I’m still on the set!
RACHEL: Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
JOEY: I know! I’m sorry! The guy’s drunk, they won’t let me go until we get this.
RACHEL: Oh my God! I’m gonna have to find another minister.
JOEY: No! No, I’m the minister! Alright, look-look, put ‘em both on the phone, I’ll marry them right now.
RACHEL: Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
JOEY: Hey! Don’t you hang up on me! I’ll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
PHOEBE: Oh hey Joey! What's up?
JOEY: I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
PHOEBE: Yeah, I've been around.
JOEY: Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
PHOEBE: Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees.
JOEY: Great! Problem solved!
JOEY: Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
ESTELLE: All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
JOEY: Why?
ESTELLE: Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
JOEY: Bastard!
PHOEBE: You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or—Oh!
PHOEBE: All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
RACHEL: Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
PHOEBE: Oh, I can't believe it!
PHOEBE: I mean I think it's great!
PHOEBE: For him.
PHOEBE: She might be able to do better.
JOEY: Hey guys!
RACHEL: Joey! Come here! Come here!
RACHEL: Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
JOEY: You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
RACHEL: No. Joey, she
PHOEBE: Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
JOEY: Yes, but y'know what?
JOEY: It doesn't matter who knows what.
JOEY: Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!
JOEY: Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
CHANDLER: It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
PHOEBE: Y’know, you’re friend’s getting married, it’s gotta change things.
RACHEL: You really think it would be that different?
PHOEBE: How could it not be?
PHOEBE: I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.
PHOEBE: And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a
RACHEL: Well, things change.
JOEY: I don’t want them to move to a
ROSS: It’ll be okay Joe.
RACHEL: Its still there!
CHANDLER: Mrs. Braverman must be out.
RACHEL: She could be out of town. Maybe she’ll be gone for months.
CHANDLER: By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
RACHEL: No that could kill her.
CHANDLER: Well, we don’t want that.
RACHEL: No, so we’re protecting her.
CHANDLER: But we should take it.
RACHEL: But we should move quick.
CHANDLER: Why?
RACHEL: Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
CHANDLER: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
CHANDLER: Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
JOEY: Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
CHANDLER: Well, you're gonna.
JOEY: I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
CHANDLER: Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
JOEY: Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.
JOEY: And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?
JOEY: Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
CHANDLER: Hey, you're not him.
CHANDLER: You're you.
CHANDLER: When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
JOEY: No.
CHANDLER: No.
CHANDLER: You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business.
CHANDLER: Now that wasn't easy, but you did it!
CHANDLER: And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
JOEY: You really think so?
CHANDLER: Yeah. I really do.
JOEY: Thanks, Chandler.
CHANDLER: Get off!
JOEY: Hi.
THE COOKING TEACHER: Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?
JOEY: When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
THE COOKING TEACHER: And the cream?
JOEY: Cheese makes me thirsty.
THE COOKING TEACHER: Okay. Let’s move on.
JOEY: All right.
THE COOKING TEACHER: Oh! Something smells good over at Monica’s station!  Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! You’ve never made this before?
MONICA: Oh no!
MONICA: I don’t know anything about cooking.
MONICA: I had to ask someone what it’s called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
THE COOKING TEACHER: Well, hats off to the chef.
MONICA: I-I-I’m sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn’t hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?
THE COOKING TEACHER: The chef!
MONICA: That’s right.
ALL: Hey, Pheebs.
PHOEBE: Hey.
MONICA: How's it going?
PHOEBE: Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
PHOEBE: So what's going on?
MONICA: Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
ROSS: I dunno, there's just something about...
CHANDLER: Basically we just feel that he's...
RACHEL: We hate that guy.
ALL: Yeah. Hate him.
ROSS: We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
PHOEBE: Uh-huh.
PHOEBE: Okay.
PHOEBE: Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
ALL: ...No, we hate him.
RACHEL: We're sorry.
ROSS: Hey!
JOEY: Hey!
ROSS: What are you doing?
JOEY: I’m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
CHANDLER: Yes that was mine.
JOEY: Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
CHANDLER: Yes that would have made more sense.
JOEY: Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man!
JOEY: All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time.
JOEY: And whatever you say, I'll believe ya.
JOEY: Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?
CHANDLER: Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
ROSS: Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
ROSS: She said what?
EMILY: She said, "If I’m not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
ROSS: Postpone it?
ROSS: Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?
ROSS: Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?
ROSS: This isn’t right.
EMILY: I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I’m sure they’ll come back when we can do it right.
ROSS: I can’t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
EMILY: Don’t you point your pants at me!
EMILY: We have no choice!
EMILY: Anywhere that’s half-decent would’ve be booked months ago, Ross don’t you understand?
EMILY: This is our wedding I’m talking about.
ROSS: The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option. This is when we’re getting married.
EMILY: So what are you saying? It’s now or never?
ROSS: No. I’m saying it’s now.
EMILY: Or?
ROSS: There’s no ‘or’ in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
EMILY: It’s not the pants.
EMILY: It’s you that is backwards.
EMILY: And if, and if you don’t understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn’t get married at all!
ROSS: No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please—
MONICA: Hi, honey.
CHANDLER: See you later.
MONICA: What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
CHANDLER: Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
THE MUSEUM OFFICIAL: Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I’m calling for Monica Geller.
MONICA: Oh no!
THE MUSEUM OFFICIAL: I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she’s still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
MONICA: Oh please, he didn’t hear it! He didn’t hear it!!
CHANDLER: This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
MONICA: NOOOO!!!!!!!!
JOEY: Ma! What're you doing here?
MRS. TRIBBIANI: I came to give you this  and this.
JOEY: Oww! Big ring!
SUSAN: Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
ROSS: Do you uh, do you talk about me?
SUSAN: Yeah, yeah, all the time.
ROSS: Really?
SUSAN: But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
MONICA: Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
RACHEL: Have you ever seen so much crap?
CHANDLER: Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
JOEY: Check this out. Can I have this?
RACHEL: What?
MONICA: I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti.
MONICA: All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office.
MONICA: It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
JOEY: If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
MONICA: Fortunately, it is me.
MONICA: And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much.
MONICA: Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate.
MONICA: Y'know, someplace nice.
JOEY: Yeah, someplace nice.
RACHEL: Yeah!
JOEY: How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
CHANDLER: So, what do you think?
ROSS: I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
CHANDLER: I know!
MONICA: So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
JOEY: Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
MONICA: Heads up Ross!  Score!  You suck!
MONICA: Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
JOEY: Gotcha.
MONICA: This place is really my Grandmother’s.
MONICA: I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this.
MONICA: So if the landlord ever asks, I’m 87 year old woman, who’s afraid of her VCR.
MONICA: So are you thirsty?
JOEY: Oh, you bet I am!
MONICA: Okay, here’s your penis!
ROSS: Ohh, okay.
RACHEL: Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
PAUL: Thank you, it’s my mom’s. So this is the kitchen.
LARRY: Hey, ready for dinner?
PHOEBE: Ooh, absolutely!
LARRY: Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
PHOEBE: Ooh, I love that place!  So, no.
LARRY: How about Mama Lisettie's?
PHOEBE: Enh. Sure!
LARRY: I wonder how long that milk  has been setting out.
PHOEBE: Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy!
PHOEBE: That—this milk is mine.
PHOEBE: I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know.
PHOEBE: Okay, let's go!
LARRY: Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the
GUNTHER: But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
LARRY: Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
PHOEBE: Okay, stop!
PHOEBE: Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy?
PHOEBE: Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
LARRY: Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
PHOEBE: Thank you.
PHOEBE: Go!
PHOEBE: Go!
PHOEBE: Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
RACHEL: No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don’t want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
PHOEBE: No but at Monica’s you can eat cookies over the sink!
RACHEL: I know. I’m sorry.
PHOEBE: All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
JOEY: Yeah.
PHOEBE: God, what a mess.
CHANDLER: Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
ROSS: Well, I lost.
ROSS: Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S.
ROSS: Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
CHANDLER: Hey! How’d the interview go?
RACHEL: Oh, I blew it. I wouldn’t of even hired me.
ROSS: Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you’re gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.
ROSS: That’s not how that was supposed to come out.
PHOEBE: This is the worst Christmas ever.
CHANDLER: Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
RACHEL: I can’t!
RACHEL: It’s too late!
RACHEL: Terry already hired that girl over there.
RACHEL: Look at her, she’s even got waitress experience.
RACHEL: Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.
ROSS: That word was swans.
FIREMAN NO. 1: What do we got there?
FIREMAN NO. 2: A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred picture—Wow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
MONICA: You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
FIREMAN NO. 3: It's all right.
FIREMAN NO. 3: It's all right.
FIREMAN NO. 3: You don't have to explain.
FIREMAN NO. 3: This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
FIREMAN NO. 1: You're our third call tonight.
RACHEL: Really?
FIREMAN NO. 2: Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
RACHEL: I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
MONICA: No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
RACHEL: Thank God. Food.
MONICA: Phoebe?
PHOEBE: What?
MONICA: Do you have a plan?
PHOEBE: I don't even have a 'pl'.
RACHEL: No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
MONICA: Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
MONICA: Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
MONICA: Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
PHOEBE: And-and a power tie?
MONICA: Oh God.
MONICA: Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
RACHEL: Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
PHOEBE: Big Bird's friend.
MONICA: I see pizza!

ROSS: Oh, now you want a favour?

ROSS: No, Rachel doesn’t want me to....
CAROL: Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you ‘cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don’t punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
ROSS: Yeah, you’re right.
MONICA: God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
PHOEBE: Oh, I know.
JOEY: I kinda feel like it's my fault.
CHANDLER: Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
JOEY: Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
CHANDLER: Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
PHOEBE: All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
CHANDLER: Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?

CHANDLER: Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the
MAITRE D': I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
CHANDLER: Is this because of the burrito thing?
MONICA: You need to give him money.
CHANDLER: Give him money? It was a joke!
MONICA: No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin’ you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
CHANDLER: Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
MONICA: You've got to be smooth about it.
CHANDLER: Hey, I can be smooth.
CHANDLER: Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
MAITRE D': Of course, sir.
CHANDLER: Okay.
TAG: I’d better get back to my desk.
RACHEL: Okay, you hard worker! I’ll remember to put that in your evaluation.
TAG: My what?
RACHEL: Well, you’ve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation.
RACHEL: But y’know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
TAG: Are you serious?
RACHEL: No, I’ve just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
CHANDLER: I can blow dry it.
CHANDLER: I can put gel on it.
CHANDLER: It doesn’t matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head.
CHANDLER: It’s so annoying.
CHANDLER: Does it bug you?
ROSS: You bug me.
CHANDLER: Is there any chance you didn’t see that?
RACHEL: Hey Joey, what ‘cha doing?
JOEY: Sweepin’. Why? Turn you on?
RACHEL: No.
JOEY: Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?

JOEY: Okay, look I’m sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn’t have, but you got porn!
RACHEL: Hey-hey, y’know what?
RACHEL: There’s nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little…erotica.
RACHEL: It’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
JOEY: You got porn!
CHANDLER: Well, I feel like a snack!
MONICA: Do you want some shortbread? Eh that’s Scottish like you are.
CHANDLER: Oh no thanks. I don’t like
ROSS: What?!
CHANDLER: Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland by…Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
ROSS: Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
MONICA: You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
ROSS: How did you know about that?!
JOEY: Hi!
THE POTENTIAL ROOMMATE: Hi!
JOEY: Come in.
JOEY: Thanks for comin’ back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and
THE POTENTIAL ROOMMATE: Great!
JOEY: Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match.

JOEY: And that they’re going to be drinking alot!
RACHEL: No, I did, but tell me again, because it’s so romantic.
JOEY: Well you’re whippin’ so slow! Can’t you do it any faster?
RACHEL: Joey!
RACHEL: Come on!
RACHEL: I don’t wanna make any mistakes, alright?
RACHEL: This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like “Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?”
RACHEL: So why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
JOEY: Oh I am!
MONICA: Ross, if you don’t tell them, then I will!
ROSS: Okay, fine!
JOEY: Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
ROSS: Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can’t? Okay.
MONICA: You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
CHANDLER: Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
MONICA: Okay, now you're even cuter!!
CHANDLER: Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
MONICA: What?
CHANDLER: The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
MONICA: What are you talking about?
CHANDLER: I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
MONICA: That's not possible!
CHANDLER: Ow!
MONICA: I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
CHANDLER: Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
MONICA: I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
CHANDLER: No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
MONICA: This bicep?
CHANDLER: Well it's not flexed right now!
PHOEBE: It's Phoebe.
PHOEBE: Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?

MELISSA: Oh well.
MELISSA: And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
RACHEL: Oh. Oh, that’s great!
BEN: Really? Like how?
RACHEL: Well y’know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we’d jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they’d put salt on their cereal.
BEN: That’s a good one.
RACHEL: Yeah? You like that one?
BEN: Yeah, you’re funny.
RACHEL: I’m funny?
RACHEL: Oh thank God!
RACHEL: Well hey, I’ve got a ton of these!
RACHEL: Umm, oh here—Do you want a good one?
RACHEL: Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge.
RACHEL: Right?
RACHEL: And then you say to person, I bet you can’t roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face.
RACHEL: And then when they do it, they’re left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
BEN: Can I do it to you?
RACHEL: Yeah, I-I-I-I’m funny Ben, but I’m not stupid. Okay?
ROSS: Chloe? Hi..

CHIP: Yeah, they still wear underwear.
JOEY: So the Porsche guy took his car back.
CHANDLER: But you found the keys to his clothes?
JOEY: No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.

RACHEL: Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!
ROSS: Hey!
RACHEL: Oh! It’s you.  Hi.
JOEY: What about me?! You-you just said I could!

ALL: Hey!
MONICA: So how was Joan?
CHANDLER: I broke up with her.
ROSS: Don’t tell me, because of the big nostril thing?
CHANDLER: They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
RACHEL: Come on, they were not that huge.
CHANDLER: I'm tellin' you, she leaned back; I could see her brain.
MONICA: How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
JOEY: Hold it, hold it.
JOEY: I gotta side with Chandler on this one.
JOEY: When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple.
JOEY: It made me nuts.
CHANDLER: You or me?
ROSS: I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
JOEY: You guys are messing with me, right?
ALL: Yeah.
JOEY: That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
