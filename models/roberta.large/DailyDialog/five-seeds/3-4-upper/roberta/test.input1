ALEX: Hey man , you wanna buy some weed ?
BLAKE:  Some what ?
ALEX:  Weed ! You know ? Pot , Ganja , Mary Jane some chronic !
BLAKE:  Oh , umm , no thanks .
ALEX:  I also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines .
BLAKE:  No , I am ok , really .
ALEX:  Come on man ! I even got dope and acid ! Try some !
BLAKE:  Do you really have all of these drugs ? Where do you get them from ?
ALEX:  I got my connections ! Just tell me what you want and I ’ ll even give you one ounce for free .
BLAKE:  Sounds good ! Let ’ s see , I want .
ALEX:  Yeah ?
BLAKE:  I want you to put your hands behind your head ! You are under arrest !
ALEX: The taxi drivers are on strike again .
BLAKE:  What for ?
ALEX:  They want the government to reduce the price of the gasoline .
BLAKE:  It is really a hot potato .
ALEX: We've managed to reduce our energy consumption in our factory by about 15 per cent in the last two years .
BLAKE:  That's excellent . How have you managed that ?
ALEX:  Mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system .
BLAKE:  What does that mean exactly ?
ALEX:  Well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers .
BLAKE:  What other sources of energy do you use ?
ALEX:  We don't use any fossil fuels . Most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants . We're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power .
ALEX: Believe it or not , tea is the most popular beverage in the world after water .
BLAKE:  Well , people from Asia to Europe all enjoy tea .
ALEX:  Right . And China is the homeland of tea .
BLAKE:  Yes , Chinese people love drinking tea so much . Some even claim they can't live without tea .
ALEX:  Do you know there are several catagories of Chinese tea ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I believe there are green teas , black teas and scented teas . Any Others ?
ALEX:  Well , have you ever heard of Oulong tea and compressed tea ?
BLAKE:  Oh , yeah . Oulong tea is good for one's health . isn't it ?
ALEX:  You surely know a lot about Chinese tea .
BLAKE:  Sure , I like drinking tea at teahouses .
ALEX:  Oh , so do I .
BLAKE:  Why don't we go for one now ?
ALEX:  Great . We can chat while enjoying a cup there .
BLAKE:  Let's go !
ALEX: What are your personal weaknesses ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m afraid I ’ m a poor talker . I ’ m not comfortable talking with the people whom I have just met for the first time . That is not very good for business , so I have been studying public speaking .
ALEX:  Are you more of a leader or a follower ?
BLAKE:  I don ’ t try to lead people . I ’ d rather cooperate with everybody , and get the job done by working together .
ALEX:  Do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English ?
BLAKE:  Yes , in most circumstances .
ALEX:  Are you available for travel ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I like travelling . I am young , and unmarried . It ’ s no problem for me to travel frequently .
ALEX: how long will it take us to drive to London ?
BLAKE:  I think it ’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to London , so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway .
ALEX:  that ’ s unless there is a traffic jam . It could take three hours .
BLAKE:  you ’ re right . We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up areas .
ALEX:  so , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ?
BLAKE:  ok . You haven ’ t seen my company car , have you ?
ALEX:  no . let me take a look ... it ’ s longer than my car .
BLAKE:  I think it ’ s over five meters long . I can ’ t remember exactly . It has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour .
ALEX:  wow ! That ’ s fast ! I don ’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway .
BLAKE:  we can ’ t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit .
ALEX: So how did I do on my driving test ?
BLAKE:  Do you want the truth ?
ALEX:  Of course , I do .
BLAKE:  Well , you really didn't do all that well .
ALEX:  How bad did I do ?
BLAKE:  To be completely honest , you failed your test .
ALEX:  How ?
BLAKE:  There were a number of reasons .
ALEX:  What were they ?
BLAKE:  Basically , you just can't drive .
ALEX:  Can I have another try ?
BLAKE:  You can take it in a couple weeks .
ALEX: Good morning . What's the matter with you ?
BLAKE:  Good morning , doctor . I have a terrible headache .
ALEX:  All right , young man . Tell me how it got started .
BLAKE:  Yesterday I had a runny nose . Now my nose is stuffed up . I have a sore throat . And I ’ m afraid I've got a temperature . I feel terrible .
ALEX:  Don't worry , young man . Lat me give you an examination . First let me take a look at your throat . Open your mouth and say'ah ' .
BLAKE:  Ah .
ALEX:  Your throat is inflamed . And your tongue is heavily coated . You have all the symptoms of influenza .
BLAKE:  What am I supposed to do then ?
ALEX:  A good rest is all you need , and drink more water . I'll write you a prescription .
BLAKE:  Thank you very much .
ALEX: My dear , what's for supper ?
BLAKE:  Red cooked carp and rape with fresh mushrooms .
ALEX:  What about soup ?
BLAKE:  Sour-peppery soup .
ALEX:  Which condiment do you use for ?
BLAKE:  I'll use ginger , garlic scallion , hot pepper and vinegar .
ALEX:  Very good , need I help you ?
BLAKE:  No , don't need , I can do myself .
ALEX:  Thanks . I can watch TV now .
BLAKE:  But you must cook that dinner next time .
ALEX:  Okay , I'll do it next time .
ALEX: Hello , this is Mike , Kara .
BLAKE:  Mike ! Good to hear from you . How are you ?
ALEX:  Everything is fine , and how are you ?
BLAKE:  Things are going well with me .
ALEX:  Kara , I had fun the other night at the movies and was wondering if you would like to go out again this Friday .
BLAKE:  Mike , I don't think that it's a good idea to go out again . I really need to focus on getting packed and ready to move back home .
ALEX:  Maybe we could just meet for coffee or something .
BLAKE:  I can't really deal with any distractions right now , but I appreciate the nice evening we spent together .
ALEX: Sun-set hotel . May I help you ?

ALEX: Could I have my bill , please ?
BLAKE:  Certainly , sir .
ALEX:  I'm afraid there's been a mistake .
BLAKE:  I'm sorry , sir . What seems to be the trouble ?
ALEX:  I believe you have charged me twice for the same thing . Look , the figure of 6.5 dollar appears here , then again here .
BLAKE:  I'll just go and check it for you , sir .
ALEX: Good evening , madam . Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I bought this sheet here yesterday .
ALEX:  Anything wrong with it ?
BLAKE:  Yes . When I spread it out back home , I found this hole .
ALEX:  Oh , how awful ! May I have a look at the invoice ?
BLAKE:  Here it is .
ALEX:  Well . please accept our sincere apologies , I'll be glad to change it for another one if you wish .
BLAKE:  That's very kind of you . Thank you .
ALEX:  We're sorry that this has happened , and I guarantee that the same mistake won't happen again .
ALEX: I need to buy some flowers for my wife .
BLAKE:  Perhaps you'd be interested in red roses .
ALEX:  What would the roses cost me ?
BLAKE:  They're only $ 20 a dozen .
ALEX:  I like the sound of that .
BLAKE:  Yes , that is today's sale price .
ALEX:  A dozen will be fine .
BLAKE:  Is there anything else you'd like to get ?
ALEX:  No , thank you .
BLAKE:  These roses should make your wife very happy .
ALEX: Room service , is there anything I can do for you ?

ALEX:  OK sir , please wait a minute .
ALEX: Why'd you pull me over ?
BLAKE:  Are you aware that you drove through a red light ?
ALEX:  I ran a red light ?
BLAKE:  Yes , you did .
ALEX:  I apologize , but I didn't realize that I did .
BLAKE:  Weren't you taught that yellow means slow down , not speed up ?
ALEX:  I did learn that .
BLAKE:  So , then why did you speed up ?
ALEX:  I don't know what to tell you .
BLAKE:  I'm going to have to write you a ticket .
ALEX:  I understand .
BLAKE:  Here you go . Don't do that again .
ALEX: Can I have the roll of film developed here ?
BLAKE:  Surely of course .
ALEX:  Here is the film . Can I get my pictures tomorrow ?
BLAKE:  Sure .
ALEX:  Besides I want two copies of all the photos .
ALEX: Tell me a little bit about yourself , please .
BLAKE:  My name is Dunlin and I live in Beijing . I was born in 1980 . I will graduate from Peking University this July . I have majored in accounting .
ALEX:  Would you tell me something about your family ?
BLAKE:  There are three in my family , my parents and myself . My father is a teacher and my mother is a worker .
ALEX: I really need to start eating healthier .
BLAKE:  I have to start eating better too .
ALEX:  What kind of food do you usually eat ?
BLAKE:  I try my best to eat only fruits , vegetables , and chicken .
ALEX:  Is that really all that you eat ?
BLAKE:  That's basically it .
ALEX:  How do you stick to only those foods ?
BLAKE:  Actually , fruits and veggies are really good for you .
ALEX:  Yeah , I know , but what about the chicken ?
BLAKE:  I mainly eat baked chicken , because there's not a lot of fat .
ALEX:  That does sound pretty good .
BLAKE:  I know it does , and that's because it is .
ALEX: Good afternoon ! Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Could you show me where the Chinesc-style clothing is located ? I want to buy a silk coat .
ALEX:  This way , please . Here they are . They're all handmade .
BLAKE:  Oh , they look nice . May I try that black one on ?
ALEX:  Of course . The fitting room is right over there .
BLAKE:  Do you have a medium in the same color ? This one is a little tight .
ALEX:  l'm sorry . All the black of that size are sold out . Would you like a red one ?
BLAKE:  OK . Let me try it on . What do you think ?
ALEX:  Oh , that suits you very well . Besides it is believed in China that the red color brings happiness and good luck .
BLAKE:  Really ? I'II take it and I'm leaving here tomorrow . Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you get it in ?
ALEX:  Our pleasure . Please fill out this form , leaving your address and telephone number .
BLAKE:  Thanks . How much would that come to ?
ALEX:  Let me see ...
ALEX: How are you today ?
BLAKE:  Great , thanks .
ALEX:  Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  I would actually like to view the apartment for rent today .
ALEX:  I ’ m sorry , but you won ’ t be able to view it today .
BLAKE:  Why not ?
ALEX:  You have to make an appointment first .
BLAKE:  Oh , okay . Can I do that right now ?
ALEX:  Is this Friday okay ?
BLAKE:  Is 6 o ’ clock Friday evening okay ?
ALEX:  Yes , I will schedule you for that time .
BLAKE:  Thank you very much . See you then .
ALEX: Today I want to invite you to talk about insurance you ’ re interested in .
BLAKE:  Thank you . I wonder whether I can enjoy the life insurance and health insurance .
ALEX:  Of course . A two-week paid vacation a year , a five-day workweek .
BLAKE:  Good . Anything else ?
ALEX:  Yes , all the insurance will be linked with your work . We will issue an insurance policy .
ALEX: Next , please . Hello , may I help you , sir ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I want to send a registered airmail letter to France .
ALEX:  Ok , it comes four dollars twenty cents .
BLAKE:  Here is five dollars .
ALEX:  Here is your change . Please wait for your receipt of the registered mail .
BLAKE:  I also want to pack up my package . This is the notes .
ALEX:  Let me see . En .. just a minute . Here it is . I need your signature on this note .
BLAKE:  Oh , one more thing , where can I mail this letter ?
ALEX:  Drop it in the mail box mark out of town . at that corner .
BLAKE:  Thank you very much .
ALEX:  You ‘ re welcome .
ALEX: we really were lucky . We got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation ! Did you see the long lines behind us ?
BLAKE:  yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving !
ALEX:  let's take a look at the menu so we can order . Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?
BLAKE:  what would you rather have , samosas or poppadoms ?
ALEX:  I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .
BLAKE:  well , let's get a plate of those then .
ALEX:  sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ?
BLAKE:  I think I might have a dahl .
ALEX:  what's in a dahl ?
BLAKE:  it's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .
ALEX:  that sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
BLAKE:  ok . How about some lamb kebabs ?
ALEX:  that's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ?
BLAKE:  I think I'll have a beer .
ALEX:  ok , shall I flag down the waitress ?
BLAKE:  I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round .
ALEX:  you're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me !
BLAKE:  what would you do without me ?
ALEX: This position demands a higher writing ability , so please say something about your writing ability .
BLAKE:  Of course . I've loved writing since I was a very little boy . I won the first prize in a national composition contest when I was in middle school . After attending Nanjing University , I never give up writing . My works , such as Father's Tobacco Pipe , Open Air Cinema , The old City were respectively published China Youth Daily , Yangzi Evening News , and New Beijing . During the period of studying for my degrees of master and doctor , I paid more attention to developing my research ability and published several papers . The Impact of Internet in Chinese Political Participation , The Discipline of Remold , The Historical Direction of Chinese Administration Reform , Bribery Cases of Self governance in Chinese Villages are respectively published in Chinese Publish Administration , Beijing Due Xuebao , Theory and Society and Chinese Reform . I joined in Yangzi Evening News to work as a part-time journalist in 2006 . During this period , I've written a lot of comments , which improved my writing ability to a new level , I have full confidence in my writing ability , and I believe I can do the job well .
ALEX: pompous . How may I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I'd like to reserve a table for dinner .
ALEX:  How large a group are you expecting ?
BLAKE:  Six couples .
ALEX:  Would you like to reserve a private dining room ?
BLAKE:  That sounds like a good idea .
ALEX:  All right . May I have your name , Sir ?
BLAKE:  My name is Ron Kollwitz .
ALEX: Ms . Wang , this is Mr . Cooper , president of Ivy Publishing .
BLAKE:  It's nice to meet you , Mr . Cooper .
ALEX:  Nice to meet you , Ms . Wang . You must be exhausted after your long trip from Canada .
BLAKE:  Yes , it was quite a long flight . I'm glad to finally be here .
ALEX: Can you help me now ?
BLAKE:  No , but I'll be able to tomorrow .
ALEX:  That'll be too late .
BLAKE:  Why don't you ask Bill if he can help ?
ALEX:  I did , but he wasn't able to either .
ALEX: Have you got any experience in advertising ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I have been working in the Public Relations Section of a company in the past two years . I plan the advertising campaign and cooperate the work of artists and typographers . Sometimes I have to do the work of a specialist when there ’ s something urgent .
ALEX:  Do you have any practical experience as a secretary ?
BLAKE:  Yes , sir . I acted as a secretary in an insurance company .
ALEX:  Would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ?
BLAKE:  Well , to begin with , I would say she needs to be diligent , and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative . Finally , she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing , summary writing , keep minutes at meetings , and so on . Most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average .
ALEX:  Have you had any experience with computer ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I studied in a computer training program , and can process data through the computer .
ALEX:  That's fine . What about operating the fax and duplicator ?
BLAKE:  I can handle them without any trouble
ALEX:  What have you learned from jobs you have held ?
BLAKE:  Above all , I have learned that what is good for the company is good for me . So I follow the instructions strictly and always keep my boss informed .
ALEX:  Very good .
ALEX: Hi , Dan . What's new ?
BLAKE:  Where have you been ? I've been trying to get in touch with you for two days .
ALEX:  I went to Salt Lake City on business . What's up ?
BLAKE:  I got fired .
ALEX:  How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ?
BLAKE:  It's a long story . In a word , I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up .
ALEX:  What are you going to do now ?
BLAKE:  I am trying to find a job asap . Lily doesn't know yet . I didn't tell her . I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought I went to work as usual .
ALEX:  That's not the way to solve the problem . Did you look in the classified advertisements column ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I did . But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in .
ALEX:  Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand .
BLAKE:  I just don't know how to bring it up . Well , all right . She has the right to know anyways .
ALEX: Have you ever gotten a parking ticket ?
BLAKE:  I've never gotten one . Have you ?
ALEX:  I got a ticket yesterday .
BLAKE:  Really ? What did you get one for ?
ALEX:  I parked in the red zone .
BLAKE:  Why did you do that ?
ALEX:  I needed to get something really quick .
BLAKE:  Where did you park at ?
ALEX:  At my apartment building .
BLAKE:  Don't you have your own parking spot ?
ALEX:  I needed to be fast .
BLAKE:  That was very lazy of you .
ALEX: How may I help you ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m having a problem .
ALEX:  What problem are you having ?
BLAKE:  There have been charges made on my debit card that I didn ’ t make .
ALEX:  Do you have the statement for your card ?
BLAKE:  Here it is .
ALEX:  What are the charges you ’ re referring to ?
BLAKE:  The last four charges on the page .
ALEX:  I ’ m afraid we ’ re going to have to investigate these charges .
BLAKE:  How long will an investigation take ?
ALEX:  I honestly don ’ t know , but we will freeze payment on these charges .
BLAKE:  That sounds absolutely fantastic .
ALEX: Good afternoon . Can I be of service ?
BLAKE:  I don't know . Can I purchase Treasury Certificates here at this counter ?
ALEX:  Yes , of course . We have Treasury Notes with two , three and five-year terms available .
BLAKE:  Two years is fine , with a value of 1,000 RIB .
ALEX:  OK , could I take a look at some ID please , like a passport ?
BLAKE:  Here you go . By the way , is it possible to cash them before the maturity comes up ?
ALEX:  No , I'm afraid that isn't possible . You must wait until maturity before you cash them .
ALEX: Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail !
BLAKE:  I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that !
ALEX:  Well you can ’ t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I ’ m the banker .
BLAKE:  Banker ?
ALEX:  Yes ...
BLAKE:  Can I have my $ 200 please ?
ALEX:  Sure . Here you are , $ 200 , Thank you , please come again ! Now it ’ s my turn to roll the dice .
ALEX: Hi , is this Professor Clark ’ s office ?
BLAKE:  This is Professor Clark speaking .
ALEX:  Hi , this is Kalina from your morning literature class .
BLAKE:  Yes , what can I do for you ?
ALEX:  I had a skydiving accident over the weekend and won ’ t be able to come to school today .
BLAKE:  My goodness ! Are you OK ?
ALEX:  I broke my leg , but it is healing .
BLAKE:  How long will you be out of class ?
ALEX:  I should be able to return by next Monday .
BLAKE:  Fine . Well , thanks for calling and letting me know you will be absent . I hope you feel better soon .
ALEX: Good afternoon ! Did you call for a plumber ?
BLAKE:  Yes , yes I did . Please come in ! I ’ m so glad you came ! This old house is falling apart ! Come on into the bathroom . See , here , there ’ s water leaking everywhere !
ALEX:  I see . Let me have a look . It seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ’ s why it won ’ t flush . Let me just get my plunger . No , that ’ s not working either . I suspect that there ’ s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage . That ’ s what ’ s making your toilet overflow .
BLAKE:  Oh , that must be because of my four-year-old daughter . She is always flushing things down the toilet . You know how kids are .
ALEX:  Yeah , I have a little one myself . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ’ t shutting off properly . I could have it all finished by today if it ’ s urgent .
BLAKE:  That would be great ! Is it expensive ?
ALEX:  Let ’ s see ... I would say about eight hundred dollars .
ALEX: Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet .
BLAKE:  I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ?
ALEX:  My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight .
BLAKE:  I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ?
ALEX:  Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .
BLAKE:  You need a babysitter .
ALEX:  Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights .
BLAKE:  I could have Suzy stay at my place .
ALEX:  I don't want to do that to you , Karen .
BLAKE:  Why not ?
ALEX:  Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .
BLAKE:  I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .
ALEX:  I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .
BLAKE:  I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .
ALEX:  I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older .
BLAKE:  I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .
ALEX:  Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .
ALEX: Good evening . What'll you have ?
BLAKE:  I'd like a beer . What kind of beer do you have ?
ALEX:  Draft beer and cans beer . Which do you prefer ?
BLAKE:  A draft beer please .
ALEX:  OK . Here you are .
BLAKE:  Could I have some fruit ?
ALEX:  Of course . Wait for a moment , please .
ALEX: Hello , Mr . Black , how are you ?
BLAKE:  Fine , thank you , and how are you ?
ALEX:  Very well , thank you . It's nice to meet you again . I am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport , as I was busy yesterday . I do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from New York .
BLAKE:  Yes , a very pleasant journey indeed . Thank you .
ALEX:  How are you getting along with your business ?
BLAKE:  Not bad . The fur market is not very brisk lately , but the selling season is advancing near . I hope there will be more buyers in the market this year .
ALEX:  I hope we can do more business together . Though we are satisfied with our past trade record , there are still possibilities for more business . In the meantime , let's discuss other spheres of cooperation , such as investment , technology transfer and technical assistance .
ALEX: By the way miss , where is the toilet ?
BLAKE:  Toilets are in the rear , I am afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment .
ALEX:  What ? Oh , what we live ! Thank you very much for your help , miss .
BLAKE:  You are welcome .
ALEX: excuse me , could you tell me which line I ’ m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package ?
BLAKE:  you can buy the bubble wrap here , but you ’ ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage .
ALEX:  that ’ s a really long line . How long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people ?
BLAKE:  it takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ’ ll probably be about an hour ’ s wait .
ALEX:  can I buy stamps here ?
BLAKE:  sure . How many would you like ?
ALEX:  I need 30 for my Christmas cards .
BLAKE:  are you sending them abroad ?
ALEX:  twenty of them are going abroad to China and America .
BLAKE:  do you have any going anywhere in the EU ? If you do , those are less expensive .
ALEX:  no .
BLAKE:  ok , here you go . That will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence .
ALEX:  and the bubble wrap ?
BLAKE:  that ’ s another quid .
ALEX:  thanks a lot . You ’ Ve been very helpful .
ALEX: Good evening , Saliva . What's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? What are you doing now ?
BLAKE:  I am cooking now !
ALEX:  Are you good at cooking ?
BLAKE:  I have studied its skills recently at a training school . I plan to run a restaurant , so I have to practise cooking !
ALEX:  It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? !
BLAKE:  I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ?
ALEX:  Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty .
BLAKE:  That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much .
ALEX:  I have the same idea as yours .
BLAKE:  It's OK . Please have a taste of it .
ALEX:  Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious .
BLAKE:  Thank you for your praise .
ALEX:  Besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ?
BLAKE:  I am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc .
ALEX:  So many dishes . Next Friday week is my birthday . I would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , OK ?
BLAKE:  Why not ? It is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking .
ALEX:  Thanks a lot .
BLAKE:  It's my pleasure .
ALEX: Room service.What can I do for you ?
BLAKE:  This is room 2012 . Where is my laundry ? You promised to send to me this morning .
ALEX:  Well , let me check for you . I am sorry , sir . They mistook your order as a normal one.Actualty it's an express laundry , is that right ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I ordered the express service .
ALEX:  Sir , we are terribly sorry for that.We will refund the charge and send your laundry to your room 3 hours later . Is that all right ?
BLAKE:  That's fine .
ALEX: I'd like you to do me a favor .
BLAKE:  What is it ?
ALEX:  Can you mail this at the post office for me ? I have to go to the doctor for an appointment and I don't have enough time to go to the post office .
BLAKE:  Sure . And I'd like you to get some cold medicine for me when you go to the doctor's .
ALEX: Excuse me , may I help you ?
BLAKE:  Would you please fill some gas for me ?
ALEX:  Sure . Which kind of gas do you want ?
BLAKE:  Unleaded , please .
ALEX:  OK .
ALEX: I'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports .
BLAKE:  It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight .
ALEX:  What about a draft at 120 days sight ?
BLAKE:  All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us .
ALEX:  A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due .
BLAKE:  Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible .
ALEX:  I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries .
BLAKE:  So do I .
ALEX: There's a new girl in school , have you seen her yet ?
BLAKE:  I haven't seen her yet .
ALEX:  I think that she is very pretty .
BLAKE:  Tell me how she looks .
ALEX:  She's kind of short .
BLAKE:  What height is she ?
ALEX:  She's probably about five feet .
BLAKE:  That's nice , but tell me what she looks like .
ALEX:  The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes .
BLAKE:  I think I might've bumped into her before .
ALEX:  Are you telling me that you've seen her before ?
BLAKE:  I believe so .
ALEX: Take a seat inside and see what you think.So you will take the Porsche then , sir ?
BLAKE:  Yes , and I want to buy the insurance too . I think it's necessary .
ALEX:  You're smart to buy it . At 45 dollars for three days , it is a good deal .
BLAKE:  Can I return the car in San Francisco ?
ALEX:  San Francisco ? No , sir.We only have this office here . You will have to return it here .
BLAKE:  Really ? I heard in America you can return rental cars in different cities .
ALEX:  No , sir . That's only with the very big companies . I'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot .
BLAKE:  Well , I guess I will have to drive back down then . Hmm . I didn't think of that .
ALEX:  Do you still want the car , sir ?
BLAKE:  Yes . It will be fun . Driving back down the coast . My girlfriend will like it .
ALEX:  It's a beautiful drive .
BLAKE:  Where are the keys ?
ALEX:  Just a moment , sir . We have to finish filling out the forms .
ALEX: Gary . Could you type up this report for me ? I have to take off early this afternoon .
BLAKE:  Sure . Just leave it to me . I'll finish it .
ALEX: Look at the show on TV . I am watching a food show at a very famous seafood restaurant . I really want to eat at that restaurant . I am a seafood lover .
BLAKE:  Speaking of seafood , my mouth is watering . Let's go to the seafood restaurant in our neighborhood .
ALEX:  Sound great . Let's go !
BLAKE:  Look at the crystal clear fridge . You can see so many kinds of seafood in it . They all look very fresh and delicious .
ALEX:  True . I would like to have some salmon sashimi and a roast salmon head .
BLAKE:  You sound like a seafood expert . I would like to have some stir-fried squids and steamed shrimps .
ALEX:  You are not too bad as well . I also want to have a steamed lobster . It is really taste like heaven .
BLAKE:  Let's go into the restaurant and find a table to order some food .
ALEX:  Wait . Let me tell the lady what we would like to order in front of the seafood fridge first .
BLAKE:  OK . I will wait for you inside the restaurant
ALEX:  Do you think we should try some deep fried oysters ?
ALEX: Where do you want to go ?
BLAKE:  I'm going to the hospital .
ALEX:  Get in . I'll take you .
BLAKE:  About how much will it cost ?
ALEX:  It will cost you $ 10 .
BLAKE:  By the way , what's the time ?
ALEX:  You can see the time on the meter . I have radio time , you know .
BLAKE:  It's a quarter to 12 . Could you please drive a little faster ?
ALEX:  Certainly .
ALEX: You're made a good choice . This china tea set is unusual .
BLAKE:  Where was it from ?
ALEX:  It was made in Jingdezhen .
BLAKE:  Jingdezhen ? Isn't it called ' the capital of porcelain ' ?
ALEX:  You are right .
BLAKE:  This is the very thing I've been dreaming of .
ALEX:  It is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell China .
BLAKE:  It must be most precious .
ALEX:  But it is really worth the price .
ALEX: Hello , Miao Li , Where are you going ?
BLAKE:  Hello , I am going to the store to buy some fruit .
ALEX:  Oh , Would you do me a favor ?
BLAKE:  Yes ?
ALEX:  Please mail this letter for me on your way to the store .
BLAKE:  Sure . Do you want it to be registered ?
ALEX:  Yes , I think so . There are some pictures in it . It would be a great pity if they were lost .
BLAKE:  Yes , I will be glad to mail your letter .
ALEX:  Thanks .
BLAKE:  you are welcome .
ALEX: I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?
BLAKE:  Alright .
ALEX:  It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .
BLAKE:  Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .
ALEX:  Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .
BLAKE:  Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .
ALEX:  It really hurts .
BLAKE:  Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?
ALEX:  To hell with you . The accident was your fault .
BLAKE:  I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?
ALEX:  To hell with you .
ALEX: Good morning . Vane Theater , at your service .
BLAKE:  Hello . I'm thinking about watching a Chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl . What's on this weekend ?
ALEX:  Well , there will be charity performance on Saturday night . And also , there will be a solo concert by an opera star on Sunday night .
BLAKE:  It's a good thing that I have choices here . Can you tell me about the one on Saturday ?
ALEX:  Sure . It's to raise money for the homeless .
BLAKE:  What about the performance itself ?
ALEX:  Oh , it's a reserved opera named The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven .
BLAKE:  Wow , a story about the clever Monkey King . It's a classic and children's favorite .
ALEX:  It surely is . And the cast is really the best .
BLAKE:  Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ?
ALEX:  The price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back .
ALEX: All right . I want to bring everybody back on this subject . When can we start working on this ?
BLAKE:  Well , we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at 2:00 .
ALEX:  I tell you what , 2:00 is not available for me , but you can get started and I'll come by at around 3:00
BLAKE:  That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ?
ALEX:  Perhaps one year , I'm not sure .
ALEX: What dressing would you like on the salad ?
BLAKE:  French dressing , please .
ALEX:  I beg your pardon ?
BLAKE:  Oh , French dressing .
ALEX:  Sorry , it's not available now.Anything else ?
BLAKE:  We still prefer French dressing .
ALEX: Could I have some fish ?
BLAKE:  Certainly . And what vegetables would you like ?
ALEX:  Oh , spinach , I think .
BLAKE:  Fine , And what about something to drink ?
ALEX:  Just a beer , please .
BLAKE:  Good . Thank you.sir .
ALEX:  Would you like to have some more beer ?
BLAKE:  No , thanks . I ' Ve had enough . I'll have my bill , please .
ALEX:  Of course . Please wait a moment . I'll go and get it .
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX: Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ?
BLAKE:  Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic .
ALEX:  Yeah , that's very important .
BLAKE:  So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment .
ALEX:  I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .
BLAKE:  That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes .
ALEX:  It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it .
BLAKE:  It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .
ALEX:  But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans .
BLAKE:  I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .
ALEX:  It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes .
BLAKE:  You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .
ALEX:  I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .
BLAKE:  You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .
ALEX:  It seems that ' clothes make the man ' .
BLAKE:  It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior .
ALEX: The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ?
BLAKE:  No idea . Your guess is as good as mine .
ALEX:  It better be more than last year .
BLAKE:  Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see .
ALEX: I'm sorry , our appointment has to be changed .
BLAKE:  What a pity !
ALEX:  If you don't mind , may we put it off to the next day ?
BLAKE:  That's OK .
ALEX: Good day ! Welcome to Lincoln Bank , how may we assist you ?
BLAKE:  Hello . I need to find out if a Receipt of Proceeds has arrived . I'm from Felix Wasserman Associates .
ALEX:  Thanks . Have you got the L / C number ?
BLAKE:  It's NX567822100007 .
ALEX:  Hang on a tick and I'll check for you . I'm sorry ; we have no record of that arriving .
BLAKE:  OK , thanks for checking . Could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ?
ALEX:  No problem . I'll be in touch as soon as it comes in .
ALEX: May I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I have to stay in your cry for just one day , can you suggest a short tour ?
ALEX:  Are you interested in the natural landscape or the human landscape ?
BLAKE:  I would prefer the first one .
ALEX:  Sure . We have a one-day trip along the river . It's quite beautiful .
ALEX: Hello , Sir . How can we help you today ?
BLAKE:  I need to find out some more information for L / C . I would like an outline of responsibilities , both ours , yours and the beneficiary , please .
ALEX:  OK , to start , the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include Insurance Forms , Way Bills , Bills of Lading , Customs forms , various certificates .
BLAKE:  OK , got it . Is there anything else I need to know before we go ahead ?
ALEX:  Just that in effect , a basic Letter of Credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank's customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds .
BLAKE:  That sounds fine , thanks for that . Let's go ahead !
ALEX: 911 emergency . What is the problem ?
BLAKE:  I would like to report a break-in .
ALEX:  When was this break-in ?
BLAKE:  I believe it happened last night .
ALEX:  Where was the break-in ?
BLAKE:  It happened at my house .
ALEX:  Was anything stolen ?
BLAKE:  I haven't checked yet .
ALEX:  Why do you think there was a break-in ?
BLAKE:  My front window was broken .
ALEX:  We'll send a squad car shortly .
BLAKE:  I'd appreciate that .
ALEX: Excuse me . How much is the chocolate bar ?
BLAKE:  One dollar .
ALEX:  So , I can have five for five dollars ?
BLAKE:  Actually , you can only have four .
ALEX:  Oh , yeah . I forgot tax . Give me four then , please .
BLAKE:  Okay . Thanks .
ALEX: House keeping.May I come in ?
BLAKE:  Come in please .
ALEX:  Good evening , sir . I come to make the bed . Shall I do it now or later ?
BLAKE:  Well , since you have come , do it now please ?
ALEX:  That's all . Have a nice stay here .
BLAKE:  Thank you.Please get some soap for us .
ALEX:  Just a moment . I will do it right now .
ALEX: Ms . Montgomery ? This is Richard Thomas . I ’ m sorry to bother you at home , but I ’ Ve got a bit of a problem .
BLAKE:  Oh ? What ’ s wrong ?
ALEX:  My daughter ’ s just banged up her knee pretty badly and I ’ m going to have to take her to the hospital . I ’ ll be about two hours late .
ALEX: Excuse me . I have an appointment with Mr . Li at nine . May I come in ?
BLAKE:  Yes , come in please . I am Mr . Li . You must be My Liu , right ?
ALEX:  Yes , I am My Liu . Thanks .
BLAKE:  I'd like to start this interview with some questions . Why do you think you are qualified for this position ?
ALEX:  According to your advertisement , you want an experienced software engineer . I think my background meets the requirement of this position .
BLAKE:  Then tell me something about your background .
ALEX:  My major was computer science when I was at college , and I am quite familiar with Visual C + + and Java language .
BLAKE:  Well , what do you think about the development in computers ?
ALEX:  The developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software . In some regions , the hardware is completely replaced by software . So I think the software industry has a great future .
BLAKE:  Have you ever designed any programs concerning network ?
ALEX:  Yes , I have designed some programs for the network with Visual C + + and I have passed the test for programmers - MUSE .
BLAKE:  Have you got anything to ask me ?
ALEX:  Yes , can you tell me what's my responsibility in this position ?
BLAKE:  Yes , of course . You would be responsible for the development of software products .
ALEX:  I see . This is my advantage .
BLAKE:  Good . Have you got any other questions ?
ALEX:  No .
BLAKE:  Ok , I will contact you in a week . See you .
ALEX:  Thank you , bye-bye .
ALEX: Tom , is Jenny crying ?
BLAKE:  Can you take he away from me ?
ALEX:  I ’ m just coming for that .
BLAKE:  She kept bothering me .
ALEX:  She ’ s your sister . What she asked was only duck soup for you . Why can ’ t you be good to her ?
BLAKE:  But I am her brother , not her servant .
ALEX: Hello , where can I buy an inexpensive cashmere sweater ?
BLAKE:  Maybe you should look around for an outlet .
ALEX:  That is a wonderful idea .
BLAKE:  Outlets have more reasonable prices .
ALEX:  Thank you for your help .
BLAKE:  No problem . Good luck
ALEX: Wow ! Your fruit looks really fresh ! How much are these apples ?
BLAKE:  The apples are 30NT each . How many would you like ?
ALEX:  Let's see , 30NT is about ... almost a dollar US . What ? ! How about these pineapples ?
BLAKE:  They're 250NT each , but they're not edible . They're only used for worship .
ALEX:  Hmm , 250NT is ... 8 dollars ? ! ! And you can't even eat them ? You're crazy !
BLAKE:  Wait ! Don't go just yet . These bananas are pretty cheap--only 35NT for this bunch .
ALEX:  Now that's more like it ! Bananas have lots of potassium , too !
BLAKE:  They're also good for your digestion ! Would you like some kiwis , too ?
ALEX:  Are they from Taiwan ?
BLAKE:  They're imported from New Zealand . Four for 50NT . Nine for a hundred .
ALEX:  OK . I'll take four kiwis .
ALEX: Amelia , could you spare a few minutes ?
BLAKE:  sure . What do you need ?
ALEX:  well , I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice .
BLAKE:  really ? Why ?
ALEX:  it's complicated . But basically it boils down to one thing . This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go .
BLAKE:  but surely they won't fire you ! You're one of the most experienced managers here !
ALEX:  well , to be honest , there's another reason . I've got a better offer .
BLAKE:  well that's great news ! Congratulations ! Where will you be located ?
ALEX:  the head office is in New York , but I'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time .
BLAKE:  it'll be sad to see you go , but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity .
ALEX:  I have . I feel lucky . I look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use English more .
BLAKE:  I'm sorry to bring this up , but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ?
ALEX:  of course I can . In fact , if there are other job opportunities at this new company , I'll recommend you personally .
BLAKE:  thanks . I appreciate that .
ALEX: What can I show you ?
BLAKE:  Do you have this shirt in a small ?
ALEX:  Let me check . Yes , we have .
BLAKE:  May I try it on ?
ALEX:  Sure . Let me help you .
ALEX: the James ’ s file , Christine ?
BLAKE:  I had it right here a minute ago , Mr . Emory . Umm . Just a minute ...
ALEX:  Christine , I know you ’ re new here and there ’ s a lot to learn , but you are going to have to learn to keep your work in better order . We can ’ t afford to lose an important document .
BLAKE:  Yes , sir . I apologize for that . Here ’ s the file you were looking for , Mr . Emory .
ALEX: I wonder whether I could possibly borrow your new bicycle now .
BLAKE:  Sorry , I'm using it myself.But you can use it this afternoon .
ALEX:  Thank you very much .
ALEX: Thanks for inviting me to work out with you , Joan .
BLAKE:  Don't mention it , let's go in .
ALEX:  Yeah , this place looks great . Wow , look at her , she can certainly get down , can't she ?
BLAKE:  She sure can . Are you jealous , Leslie ?
ALEX:  A little , I wish I could do that .
BLAKE:  You can ! With a little practice .
ALEX:  Look at him , he's buff .
BLAKE:  I think he's hot too .
ALEX:  How do they all get in such tiptop shape ?
BLAKE:  Exercised over and over . Exercise is a key .
ALEX:  That's it . I decided to turn over a new leaf . I'm going to exercise every single day .
BLAKE:  Good for you , Leslie !
ALEX: Excuse me . Check please .
BLAKE:  OK , how was everything ?
ALEX:  Very nice . Thank you .
BLAKE:  Would you like this to-go ?
ALEX:  Yes , can you put it in a plastic bag ?
BLAKE:  Sure , no problem . Here you are . That'll be 25 dollars .
ALEX:  Do you take credit cards ?
BLAKE:  Yes , we accept Visa and MasterCard .
ALEX:  OK , here you are .
BLAKE:  Thanks . I'll be right back .
ALEX:  OK .
BLAKE:  Here's your receipt .
ALEX:  Thank you .
BLAKE:  You're welcome . Please come again .
ALEX: You look upset , anything wrong ?
BLAKE:  I'm going to quit the job .
ALEX:  Why ?
BLAKE:  The task is tough .
ALEX:  You'd look before you leap .
BLAKE:  Thanks for your concern .
ALEX: How long will you stay in New York ?
BLAKE:  Just tor three days . I won't need these luggages.CouId I put them here ?
ALEX:  I am sorry . If you have here more than 24 hours between connecting flights , we can't check your luggage through London .

ALEX:  That's right . It's over there .
ALEX: Eat some more .
BLAKE:  No , thanks . I'm on a diet .
ALEX: Excuse me . Do you know where the Admiral Hotel is ?
BLAKE:  That's over on Callaway Street , isn't it ?

BLAKE:  Walk that way for about four blocks . The hotel's about two blocks north of there .

BLAKE:  Better late than never .
ALEX: Professor Li , do you know where to buy art supplies ?

BLAKE:  Oh , good . How old is your niece ?
ALEX:  She is eight . Actually , I'm buying a good set of art supplies for her as a birthday gift .
BLAKE:  It's a wise thing to do . Art will do a child a world of good .
ALEX: Hello ?

BLAKE:  I'm afraid he's fully engaged.Could you make it another time ?
ALEX: Hey ! What are you doing here ?
BLAKE:  I'm just shopping .

BLAKE:  Some new clothes . How about you ?
ALEX:  Same here .

BLAKE:  No , I haven't got one by now . I will go to the interview of yours .
ALEX: I need help with the office party .
BLAKE:  Yes , of course . We could split it . What part would you like to do , the food or the entertainment ?
ALEX:  I have no idea what the entertainment should be .
BLAKE:  Let's make sure we are on the same page . Do we want a formal or informal gathering ?
ALEX:  Let's make it a formal affair .
BLAKE:  Yes , that would be best . Now , for food should we have Chinese or American food ?
ALEX:  American food would be the best choice .
BLAKE:  That would be great . What kind of music would you like , a band or recorded music ?
ALEX:  We should bring in a really good DJ .
BLAKE:  That works for me . Let's see what we can each do about planning our part and meet again on Friday .
ALEX: Help ! Help !
BLAKE:  What's the matter ?
ALEX: What would you like to eat , sir ?
BLAKE:  Scrambled egg , bacon , three pieces of bread and a cup of tea .
ALEX:  Would you care for some lemon for your tea ?
BLAKE:  No , thank you .
ALEX: Where's the toilet ?
BLAKE:  Over there .
ALEX: Only one . But I wanted to make sure I'd get it .
BLAKE:  Yeah , I really wanted that Chanel bag , too . But just in case you should bid low .
ALEX:  But there are only two more days until the bidding closes !
BLAKE:  I bid on a Chanel watch at the last minute , and got it sixty percent off !
ALEX:  Oh ... I'm such a newbie . But at least I'm sure I'll get that tennis racket .
BLAKE:  Don't count on it , Babe . eBay is always full of surprises .

BLAKE:  Oh , my God ! I hope you are all right .
ALEX:  I have a concussion , but I will be OK .
BLAKE:  How much school will you miss ?
ALEX:  I only need to take this week off .
BLAKE:  I appreciate you calling and telling me that you won ’ t be in class . See you next week !

ALEX:  Great .
ALEX: How come it is slow as a snail today ?
BLAKE:  You mean the network connection ?
ALEX:  Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response to any click .
BLAKE:  I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately .
ALEX:  Ok .
ALEX: Honey , I need to have a talk with you .
BLAKE:  Dad , I have to do my homework .
ALEX:  No , honey , why didn't you go to cram school last night ?
BLAKE:  Dad , I don't want to talk about it now .
ALEX:  Honey , if you don't want to go to cram school , you should tell me the reason why .
BLAKE:  I'm sorry , dad . But I would rather stay at school than go to cram school .
ALEX: What's wrong with you , young man ?
BLAKE:  Doctor , I have a bad cough and a headache .
ALEX:  Do you have a fever ?
BLAKE:  I don't know , but I feel terrible .
ALEX:  Let me examine you . Don't worry . It's nothing serious .
BLAKE:  Do you think I should lie in bed ?
ALEX:  Yes , stay in bed and drink a lot of water . Your fever will be gone in a day or two .
BLAKE:  OK . Do you think I can play football tomorrow ?
ALEX:  Of course not . You need a good rest .
BLAKE:  OK , I'll listen to you .
ALEX: I want something sweet after dinner .
BLAKE:  What do you have in mind ?
ALEX:  A dessert sounds nice .
BLAKE:  What kind are you thinking of getting ?
ALEX:  I want to get some pie .
BLAKE:  What kind of pie do you want ?
ALEX:  I have no idea .
BLAKE:  Do you want to know what kind of pie I like ?
ALEX:  Sure , what kind do you like ?
BLAKE:  I love apple pie .
ALEX:  Oh , I love apple pie too .
BLAKE:  There you go . Problem solved .
ALEX: Let's go now .
BLAKE:  I'll be with you in a minute .

BLAKE:  Yes . Do you exchange foreign money here ?
ALEX:  Yes . Our bank is authorized to deal with foreign exchange .
BLAKE:  What kinds of currency do you change ?
ALEX:  We can change only three kinds of currency , USD , Japanese Yen and HK Dollar in our savings office .
BLAKE:  Could you tell me what the exchange rate for USD is today ?
ALEX:  The buying rate is 826 . 44 yuan for 100 dollars .
BLAKE:  I want to change some Us dollars to cover my expense here .

BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX: I want to see the man responsible for selling typewriters .
BLAKE:  My name is Steven . I'm the Sales Manager of this company .
ALEX:  Well , look here . Ten new typewriters were delivered to my company yesterday afternoon and only five of them work properly .
BLAKE:  Oh , I'm sorry about that .
ALEX:  Never mind being sorry , what are you going to do about it ?
BLAKE:  Don't worry , we'll soon fix them .
ALEX:  Good , I hope you'll make sure that it won't happen again .
BLAKE:  I'll certainly look into that .
ALEX:  Thank you . Goodbye .
ALEX: I'm looking for a string of pearls for my wife .
BLAKE:  Yes , sir . What price range do you have in mind ?
ALEX:  I'm not sure . I don't know very much about the price of pearls .
BLAKE:  I see . Let me show you some samples of various qualities . This one is very nice . It's three hundred and fifty dollars .
ALEX:  Is there a price reduction ?
BLAKE:  We are having a sale now . The price has already gone down .
ALEX:  How much is that one ?
BLAKE:  It's two hundred and eighty dollars .
ALEX:  OK . I'll take it . Thank you .
ALEX: Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I would like to buy a Walkman . Can you tell me about the models you have ?
ALEX:  Well , we have a lot of models here.Did you want to listen to CD's or cassettes or the radio ?
BLAKE:  Mostly cassette tapes .
ALEX:  Alright . There are several models you may want to look at.This Kreng portable cassette player is very good .
BLAKE:  Kreng ? I've never heard of that company .
ALEX:  It's a German company.This unit has auto-reverse , recording capability , and an AM / FM radio band.It also has a built-in microphone .
BLAKE:  I suppose I don't want that one then . I don't like auto-reverse . It breaks too easily .
ALEX:  Really ? Have you had an auto-reverse break before ?
BLAKE:  Yes , twice now . I think it's too high-tech , and so it's the first part that breaks .
ALEX:  Hmm . You know , the problem might be dust . Did you clean the unit often ?
BLAKE:  Well . No , I didn't clean it.But still , I only had the last one two months , and it broke . I don't trust auto-reverse .
ALEX:  Alright . Well . We have many units without auto-reverse.Here is a good unit . Very reliable.It has an AM / FM band , built-in microphone , recording capability , and no auto-reverse .
BLAKE:  How much is it ?
ALEX:  This one sells for $ 39.99 .
BLAKE:  Can I test it out ?
ALEX:  Of course .
BLAKE:  It sounds great . I'll take it .
ALEX:  Fine . I think you'll be happy with it . It's a very good unit . Very reliable . I'll go get you a new one in a box . I will be back in just a moment .
BLAKE:  Thanks .
ALEX: Tell me about yourself .
BLAKE:  I was born and raised in Beijing . I attended Peking University and received my bachelor's degree in Economics . I have worked for 2 years as a financial consultant in Beijing for China Pacific Insurance Co . Ltd .
ALEX:  What type of position are you looking for ?
BLAKE:  I'm looking for a position in which I can utilize my experience .
ALEX:  Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position ?
BLAKE:  I am more interested in a full-time position . However , I would also consider a part-time position .
ALEX:  Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ?
BLAKE:  I advised customers on financial matters . After I consulted the customer , I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis .
ALEX:  What is your greatest strength ?
BLAKE:  I am an excellent communicator . People trust me and come to me for advice . One afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
ALEX:  What is your greatest weakness ?
BLAKE:  I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . However , I began setting time-limits for myself .
ALEX:  Why do you want to work for our company ?
BLAKE:  After following your firm's progress for the last 3 years , I am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and I would like to be a part of that team .
ALEX:  When can you begin ?
BLAKE:  Immediately .
ALEX: Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules .
BLAKE:  Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things .
ALEX:  What are they ?
BLAKE:  They are keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
ALEX:  And what is the most important point ?
BLAKE:  You should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .
ALEX: Yeah , look at all those new buildings going up ! Mr . Zhang , the traffic is pretty smooth . But we were told the roads from the airport to downtown were quite crowded and traffic jams could be as long as half an hour .
BLAKE:  Yes , they were . But it has already past . The traffic from the airport to downtown has been relieved after the completion of Yan'an Aerial Road .
ALEX:  We've never expected that Shanghai is such a big metropolis , same as New York city . David , would it be a good idea to rent a car here ? I've got an international driver's license with a pretty good record in the States .
BLAKE:  That's wonderful . OK . I'll remember that . But I have to warn you that you must drive very carefully in the downtown area , for there're no separate lanes for motor vehicles and bicycles in some places , and still quite a few people don't take road regulations seriously .
ALEX: This house is not looking all that great from here
BLAKE:  You can ’ t really tell everything about a house from the outside . Let ’ s go inside .
ALEX:  I don ’ t think that it is looking any better inside here .
BLAKE:  I think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better .
ALEX:  It is just too dark in here with so few windows .
BLAKE:  I hear that the kitchen is quite large . Let ’ s go check it out .
ALEX:  The kitchen may be large , but it doesn ’ t have any storage space .
BLAKE:  The master suite is supposed to be quite elegant . Maybe it will be a little better .
ALEX:  How many dogs live in this house ?
BLAKE:  I think that we have seen all that we need to see here . Let ’ s go look at another house .
ALEX: Excuse me , waiter , I would like to have some wine before the main course .
BLAKE:  Have you decided what wine you would like ?
ALEX:  I have no idea . Maybe you can give me some advice .
BLAKE:  I recommend you the white wine . It will wake up your appetite .
ALEX:  That's great , bring me a bottle of that please .
ALEX: Come on ! It's time to go !
BLAKE:  Wait a minute ! Just hold your horses ! What's your hurry , anyway ?
ALEX:  Well , I've got to stop and get gas in the car , first .
BLAKE:  That won't take long .
ALEX:  Well , it won't if there no line at the pump .
BLAKE:  Well , I'm not quite ready .
ALEX:  I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you !
BLAKE:  You wouldn't do a thing like that !
ALEX:  Oh , yes , I would !
ALEX: I wonder if I can see your mother , little boy . Is she engaged ?
BLAKE:  Engaged ? She ’ s married .
ALEX:  Johnny , I wish you ’ d stop reaching for things . Haven ’ t you a tongue ?
BLAKE:  Yes , Mother , but my arm is longer .
ALEX: Hello ! Tomorrow I'm going to need a wake-up call .
BLAKE:  Not a problem . What time shall we call you ?
ALEX:  I always hit the snooze button , so give me two calls , one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen .
BLAKE:  It'll be our pleasure . We'll call you at 7 and then at 7 fifteen .
ALEX:  Oops , cancel that . Change the second call to 7 thirty will you , please ?
BLAKE:  No sooner said than done . Can I help you with anything else ?
ALEX:  No , that's about it for now . Thanks .
BLAKE:  Okay , sir . Have a pleasant evening .
ALEX: Have you seen our new packing specifications ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I have , Mr . Thomas . We'll pack them two dozen to one carton , and the gross weight is around 25 kilos a carton .
ALEX: I'm really in a flap about the interview .
BLAKE:  Take it easy.you ' Ve made enough preparations .
ALEX:  I'm in such a need of the job that I can't afford any mistakes .
BLAKE:  I'm sure you'll pass it .
ALEX: Do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff ?
BLAKE:  Let me see . Laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture lotion , ... Oh , that is too much . You are not going to a business trip .
ALEX:  I guess I need all of them .
BLAKE:  Actually , the company will provide you with all of these supplies . So , you can leave this very thick notebook at home .
ALEX:  I know . But it is my lucky charm . I carry it all the time .
BLAKE:  Suit yourself . Don ’ t forget to set the alarm clock .
ALEX: May I know where you are going ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I want to go to Beijing Hotel .
ALEX:  I'm sorry . You are going in the wrong direction .
BLAKE:  Oh no ! What shall I do ?
ALEX:  Don't worry . You can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass . The bus stop is right there .
BLAKE:  Thank you very much .
ALEX:  My pleasure .
ALEX: Steven , shall we go shopping tomorrow ?
BLAKE:  Hum ... Why not go shopping the day after tomorrow ? Tomorrow is Saturday . I hate all the hustle and bustle of Saturday shopping .
ALEX:  But Sunday is the same with Saturday . If you don ’ t mind , that's OK .
BLAKE:  Hum.Maybe it will be better . The most important thing is that I can have a day to relax after a week's work .
ALEX:  I see . We will go the day after tomorrow .
BLAKE:  By the way , what kind of stores do we need to go ?
ALEX:  I want to buy some clothes in clothing store . When we are going back , go to the butcher's shop and buy some chicken .
BLAKE:  Let ’ s also go to the jewelry store to buy a crystal necklace . I want to buy one for you as your birthday present .
ALEX:  Thank you , darling .
ALEX: Have you seen the tower in front of us . That's the famous Eiffel Tower . It was built in 1889 for the World's Fair .
BLAKE:  How tall is this building ?
ALEX:  It stands 320m ( 1050ft ) high and held the record as the world's tallest structure until 1930 .
BLAKE:  I have heard its name is connected with someone , is that right ?
ALEX:  Yes , the towel was named after its designer Gustave Eiffel .
ALEX: Good afternoon ! Trans Pacific Airline . How can I help you ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m calling to cancel my reservation for Trans Pacific Flight 8 on July 19 from Taipei to Minneapolis . Could you please make it for the same flight on August 2 instead of July 19 ?
ALEX:  What ’ s your name , please ?
BLAKE:  My name is Judy Wang .

BLAKE:  My first name is J-U-D-Y , and my last name is W-A-N-G .

ALEX:  That ’ s correct .
BLAKE:  Thank you !
ALEX:  Is there anything else I can do for you ?
BLAKE:  No , thanks . I ’ m all set . Good-bye .
ALEX: Is this supply ?
BLAKE:  Yeah . This is supply . What can I do for you ?
ALEX:  This is Rachel in Human Resources . I need two boxes of company letterhead , one box of ball-point pens , and a box of envelopes .
BLAKE:  All right . No problem . What ’ s your extension ?
ALEX: John , I ’ d like you to meet Charles Brown , our new manager at the airport .
BLAKE:  Yes , certainly . How can I recognize him ?
ALEX:  He is short , well-built , and he ’ s got light blond hair .
BLAKE:  Is there anything else ?
ALEX:  He has a mustache , if I remember correctly , and a light complexion .
BLAKE:  How old is he ?
ALEX:  He is in his late thirties .
BLAKE:  Well . I shouldn ’ t have any trouble recognizing him . What time does his flight arrive ?

BLAKE:  Could I get a hamburger , please ?
ALEX:  Would you like cheese on that ?
BLAKE:  No , thank you .
ALEX:  Would you like a drink ?
BLAKE:  Let me have a soda .
ALEX:  What kind of soda would you like ?
BLAKE:  May I have a Sprite , please ?
ALEX:  Sure , no problem .
BLAKE:  I would also like a bag of chips .
ALEX:  Will that be all ?
BLAKE:  That's everything .
ALEX: Please tell me something about your insurance background .
BLAKE:  I majored in international banking at college so I took many insurance courses . And I worked at an insurance company for my graduation field work .
ALEX:  Why do you want to be an insurance agent ?
BLAKE:  I care about people and I know the importance of insurance .
ALEX:  Do you have any work experience in promotion ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I do . I have worked as a salesman for P & G Company Ltd .
ALEX:  Do people respond well to you ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I'm good with people .
ALEX: Ah , here we are .
BLAKE:  This is the place I was telling you about .
ALEX:  Would you like to sit near the window ?
BLAKE:  Good .
ALEX:  Let's have a look at the menu . Oh , there isn't a menu . Do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ?
BLAKE:  Yes , of course . Excuse me . Could you possibly let us see your menu ? Oh . They haven't got one either .
ALEX: Are you going to buy a bicycle ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m thinking about it . How much is it ?
ALEX:  ¥ 350 .
BLAKE:  Oh , dear . It ’ s too expensive . Can you give me a better price ?
ALEX:  Your discount is already included . Normally we charge ¥ 400 , but now we can give you a special price . This is our sale period .
BLAKE:  It ’ s still too much . Can ’ t you make it any cheaper than that ?
ALEX:  Sorry , but this is the best price . You can ’ t get it any cheaper than here .
BLAKE:  I see . Can I pay by traveler ’ s checks ?
ALEX:  I'm afraid you can ’ t . You ’ re welcome to pay in cash .
ALEX: Do you have a free moment ?
BLAKE:  Sure . What do you need ?
ALEX:  I'm having some trouble . How do you use this printer ?
BLAKE:  Well , first you have to turn this switch on .
ALEX:  Silly me .
BLAKE:  Now press this button .
ALEX:  Oh , and it's out of paper . Do you have any more ?
BLAKE:  Just a second . I'll go get some .
ALEX: I need help using the washer and dryer .
BLAKE:  Tell me what the problem is .
ALEX:  I can't figure out how to turn them on .
BLAKE:  Do you have some quarters ?
ALEX:  I didn't know I needed change .
BLAKE:  The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar .
ALEX:  Where do I put the change ?
BLAKE:  The quarters go into the slot . You have to push the slot in , and the machine will turn on .
ALEX:  Is that everything that I have to do ?
BLAKE:  That's all there is .
ALEX:  I appreciate you helping me with this .
BLAKE:  If you need anything else , just let me know .
ALEX: Do you have any questions ?
BLAKE:  Yes , do I have to work a whole year before I can take a vacation ?
ALEX:  Yes , after you ’ Ve been here a year , you qualify for a three-day vacation
BLAKE:  Only three days ?
ALEX:  That's the company policy .
BLAKE:  What happens if I use up my sick days before the end of the year ? If I ’ m sick an extra day or two , will my pay be deducted ?
ALEX:  Yes . That's the company policy .
BLAKE:  It was the same as the last place I worked at . I was hoping you ’ d be different .
ALEX: I am absolutely famished .
BLAKE:  Yeah . I am too .
ALEX:  Where did you want to go for lunch ?
BLAKE:  I was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria .
ALEX:  I don't think I ever got food from the cafeteria .
BLAKE:  I actually like the food there .
ALEX:  Does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food ?
BLAKE:  They have anything you want .
ALEX:  I was thinking about getting some Chinese food .
BLAKE:  I bought some chow mein at the cafeteria . It tasted great .
ALEX:  We can eat at the cafeteria .
BLAKE:  I think you'll really like the food there .
ALEX: Here is the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract . After that , what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names .
BLAKE:  That's OK .
ALEX:  The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective .
BLAKE:  Fine . If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared .
ALEX:  Thank you .
BLAKE:  Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time .
ALEX:  That's a good idea .
BLAKE:  First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . That'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract .
ALEX:  Agreed .
BLAKE:  For shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . So would you allow us to make partial shipments .
ALEX:  I understand your position .
ALEX: I want to buy a black suit .
BLAKE:  Certainty.Do you want double breasted suit or single breasted suit ?
ALEX:  I prefer single breasted suit .
BLAKE:  What about this one ? It's a very nice 3 - piece suit .
ALEX:  That looks great . Do you have ties here ?
ALEX: How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Diane .
BLAKE:  How do you do , Jack . Nice to meet you .
ALEX:  Well , I think you ' Ve reconsidered our proposal , Diane .
BLAKE:  Yes , you are right . After all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . The only problem is price .
ALEX:  I should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . Do you have any suggestion in mind ? Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable .
BLAKE:  That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 .
ALEX:  That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount .
BLAKE:  I see your point . That's to say s 611 each set . Still it's much higher than the market price . Could you see your way to reduce the price , Jack ?
ALEX:  Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . That's the best we can do . What do you think of that ?
BLAKE:  All right . We accept it . So $ 600 for each set .
ALEX:  Very well . Thank you .
ALEX: Don't I know you ?
BLAKE:  I'm not sure.You look familiar .
ALEX:  You're Mr.Stevenson , right ?
BLAKE:  Yes.And you're Mr.Jones , I remember .
ALEX: That's all the general information of our company . I think you already have good knowledge about our company .
BLAKE:  Yes , I have an overall understanding .
ALEX:  When we have the final results , we will call you .
BLAKE:  Then when will I get a reply at the latest ?
ALEX:  If you pass the interview , the personnel department will inform you within two weeks .
BLAKE:  But if I don't pass , will you call me ?
ALEX:  I'm sorry we won't . You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful .
BLAKE:  Then do I have the chance to get this job ?
ALEX:  I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself , and I have to discuss it with other interviewers .
BLAKE:  I know . No matter what the result will be , I have learned a lot from our conversation .
ALEX:  Your mentality is very good and that's great .
BLAKE:  Thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview .
ALEX:  My pleasure .
ALEX: I have a stomachache .
BLAKE:  Well , you'd better lie down now . You need a good rest .
ALEX:  All right . I'll do that .
ALEX: What kind of personality do you think you have ?
BLAKE:  I'm quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like to leave things half-done .
ALEX:  Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
BLAKE:  I'm quite outgoing i think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
ALEX:  What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
BLAKE:  I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself I think . A friend in need is a friend in deed.The more really close friends I have , the better .
ALEX:  What kind of people do you like to work with ?
BLAKE:  People who are honest , dedicated to their work and having integrity .
ALEX: I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Monica to our company and introduce her to her department and colleagues . For all of you , we hired Monica because she is a very professional accountant and we are very happy to have her in the finance department . She has lots of working experiences as an accountant and I am sure everybody in the department can benefit from this .
BLAKE:  Hello , everybody . I am Monica and this is my first day at work . I am working in the finance department . I am very happy to meet everyone and I am looking forward to working well with all of you . I am very happy to be one of the team and I will do my best to get into the working situation as soon as possible . By the way , call me Monica . Everybody calls me so .
ALEX: Were you in a leadership position when you were a college student ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I was president of the Student Council of our university .
ALEX:  Did you get any honors or awards at your university ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I was elected Excellent Party Member for four academic years .
ALEX:  Were you involved in any club activities at your university ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I was a member of the Student Poetry Society . I like writing poems in my spare time .
ALEX:  What extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ?
BLAKE:  I sometimes played table tennis and sometimes played basketball .
ALEX: Margaret , I'd like to follow up with the arrangements for our company retreat , to take place next month . We need to book the venue , make arrangements for speakers and door prizes , and set up all the activities and accommodations . Also , very important , we need to determine which of our staff will be eligible and will be available to go . We've got to get a head count in order to make reservations .
BLAKE:  What's the criteria for staff to attend ? Are we only including our management team in this affair ? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ?
ALEX:  Lower level employees need not attend . The purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level . In order to get everyone to jell together , we've got to include some fun . That's the reason for the retreat .
ALEX: I think Yoga might be suitable for me .
BLAKE:  Why ?
ALEX:  Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
BLAKE:  But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too .
ALEX:  I don't know . I just need to try it once . I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight .
BLAKE:  You should try swimming then . It helps you to keep fit .
ALEX: We are looking for a bilingual secretary . Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ?
BLAKE:  I think my English is fairly good . As you can see from my CV , I graduated from university with a B . A . degree in English . I studied the English language and English literature systematically .
ALEX:  How are your typing and shorthand skills ?
BLAKE:  I can type 80 words a minute , basically no mistake , and can take dictation in English at 120 words per minute .
ALEX: Are these the clothes you want to have washed ?
BLAKE:  Yes . When can I get them back ?
ALEX:  Well , if they are collected right now , you can get them back tonight .
BLAKE:  That's fine . By the way , please have that suit dry cleaned .
ALEX:  OK . Please fill in the form first .
ALEX: What's the matter with me , Doctor ? I feel so tired these days .
BLAKE:  Is your blood pressure , I'm afraid . It's far too high .
ALEX:  And what's the cause of that ?
BLAKE:  Overwork-amongst other things . You can't work 24 hours a day . You ' Ve got to slow down .
ALEX:  But I can't just slow down .
BLAKE:  You've got to , I'm afraid . And look at this . You weigh 200 stones . That's too much for a man of your size .
ALEX:  You mean I've got to lose weight ?
BLAKE:  Yes . You've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise .
ALEX: You are an early bird , Tom . What do you do in the morning then ?
BLAKE:  Exercise . The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . We should not pass them up easily . Seize the time and do something useful .
ALEX:  So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ?
BLAKE:  Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities .
ALEX:  Do you do the same exercises every day ?
BLAKE:  No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park .
ALEX:  Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ?
BLAKE:  It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them .
ALEX:  Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally .
ALEX: I want some cosmetics.Could you recommend some ?
BLAKE:  I think Pond's is the best .
ALEX:  And they're very dear , too .
BLAKE:  They're on special offer today .
ALEX:  Oh , that's ideal .
ALEX: Steven , I'm going abroad by plane for the first time tomorrow . Can you give me some advice ? And what should I pay attention to ?
BLAKE:  First , you should have enough sleep to get over the jet lag before the departure . Most people will suffer from jet lag for a few days after a long flight .
ALEX:  I will go to bed early tonight .
BLAKE:  Do you have an airsickness ?
ALEX:  I don't know . But I have a carsickness .
BLAKE:  You'd better bring some medicine for airsickness .
ALEX:  Thank you .
ALEX: Can we choose a time to look at houses together ?
BLAKE:  Can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ?
ALEX:  Either way is good for me .
BLAKE:  There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area . Would that okay with you ?
ALEX:  I can take a little time off of work , or I can go on a weekend , also .
BLAKE:  We could meet at the real estate office , or I could pick you up at your home .
ALEX:  I am leaving from work , so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at .
BLAKE:  I can think of five houses that we should look at . It will take most of the day .
ALEX:  I would like to see as many as possible .
BLAKE:  When I have confirmed the times with the owners , I will e-mail you our plans for the day .
ALEX: Do you have a package tour to Hollywood ?
BLAKE:  Yes , here is the table , which plans do you like best ?
ALEX:  The seven-days trip shall be fine . How much is this tour ?
BLAKE:  $ 300 .
ALEX:  We will take the trip . Could you give us a pamphlet ?
BLAKE:  Here you are .
ALEX: What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong .
BLAKE:  What do you mean ?
ALEX:  Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way .
ALEX: Mom , when you come home , please buy a coat , a skirt , a sweater ...
BLAKE:  Enough is enough . I know .
ALEX: Mr.Chen , do you mind if I smoke ?
BLAKE:  I'm sorry , Mrs . Lin . We don't allow smoking in the office .
ALEX: Good morning , can I help you ?
BLAKE:  I want to American breakfast with fried eggs sunny side up .
ALEX:  What kind of juice do you prefer , sir ?
BLAKE:  Breakfast juice and please make my coffee very strong .
ALEX:  Yes , sir . American breakfast with fried eggs sunny side up . Breakfast juice and black coffee . And my correct , sir ?
BLAKE:  Yes , that ’ s right .
ALEX:  Is there anything else , sir ?
BLAKE:  No , that ’ s all .

BLAKE:  Just put it on the table please .
ALEX:  Do you need anything else , sir ?
BLAKE:  No , thanks . Oh , yes , could I have some juice for the mini bar ?
ALEX:  What kind of juice do you like sir ?
BLAKE:  Tomato or orange juice , please .
ALEX:  Yes , sir . I ’ ll get them for you right away . Would you please sign this bill first ? Thank you , sir .
ALEX: Should we tip ? This service is pretty good .
BLAKE:  Yeah , we probably should.How much is normal ?
ALEX:  How about 10 percent ? That's about 6 dollars .
BLAKE:  That sounds about right .
ALEX: What time does the train for Tibet leave ?
BLAKE:  It will leave at 3:00 p . m .
ALEX:  When does it arrive ?
BLAKE:  It should be due in at 7:30 a . m.tomorrow .
ALEX:  How much is the ticket ?
BLAKE:  It's 86 coach and 175 berths
ALEX:  One berth , please .
ALEX: Hey , taxi .
BLAKE:  Where to , sir ?
ALEX:  Beijing Library .
BLAKE:  Hop in , please .
ALEX:  Is it a long ride to Beijing Library ?
BLAKE:  It will take about thirty minutes because it is the rush hour .
ALEX:  Thirty minutes , that will be all right . There are still fifty minutes to go before the library is open . Look , what are they doing on the square ?
BLAKE:  It is an exhibition of Chinese jades . It is held each year . A nice collection jades of are on display and sold .
ALEX:  Sounds great ! Can you stop somewhere here for a minute ? I will get some souvenirs for my friends .
BLAKE:  No problem .
ALEX: How many pieces of luggage would you like to check in , sir ?
BLAKE:  Three bags and a suitcase . This is my luggage to check .
ALEX:  Do you have any carry-on luggage ?
BLAKE:  No .
ALEX:  Put your luggage on the scale , please . Oh , your luggage is overweight .
BLAKE:  How much is the excess baggage part charge ?
ALEX:  Twenty-two dollars
BLAKE:  Here you are .
ALEX:  This is your voucher , and you can get your luggage back on this . Have a good trip !
BLAKE:  Thank you !
ALEX: What date would you like to depart , sir ?
BLAKE:  Do you have any seats for September 16th ?
ALEX:  Let's see ... I'm afraid the 16th is fully booked . But I have seats for the 17th .
BLAKE:  The 17th will be fine .
ALEX:  And what date will you be returning ?
BLAKE:  Hmm , I guess on the 28th .
ALEX:  Okay , you're booked on American Airlines flight 710 , departing JFK at 6
BLAKE:  Sounds good . Thanks a lot .
ALEX: I would like to buy a black suit .
BLAKE:  Do you have any special brand in your mind ?
ALEX:  No , I never wear suit in my everyday life . I just want one to take part in my sister ’ s wedding ceremony .
BLAKE:  I see . Have a look at this one . It ’ s very cheap because it ’ s not very durable .
ALEX:  but it looks good . Let me try it on .
BLAKE:  Ok , the mirror is over there .
ALEX: What can I do for you , miss ?
BLAKE:  I am looking for a pair of shoes .
ALEX:  Do you like high heels or flat shoes ?
BLAKE:  High hells , please . I want to wear them in formal situations .
ALEX: Hi Jim . Do you have a minute ?
BLAKE:  Sure , what ’ s up ?
ALEX:  Some of us are going to start a soccer team . Would you like to join us ?
BLAKE:  I don ’ t know anything about it . Soccer isn ’ t as popular in my country as it is here .
ALEX:  That ’ s all right . We ’ ll teach you .
BLAKE:  Is it anything like American football ?
ALEX:  Not very much . It ’ s something like hockey , except that you use a big ball and no stick .
BLAKE:  I ’ ll come down and watch you play some day , and see what it ’ s like .
ALEX:  Good idea . I think you ’ ll like it if you give it a chance .
ALEX: Do you remember what the ratings of movies stand for ?
BLAKE:  Yes , G stands for General Audiences , PG means Parental Guidance suggested , R is restricted to audiences under 18 and X means explicit content .
ALEX:  Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ?
BLAKE:  Remember when we were kids ? Theaters wouldn't let kids in to PG moves without a parent .
ALEX:  I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed .
BLAKE:  Now with video rentals it's all a personal matter .
ALEX:  Yea , I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either .
BLAKE:  Now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't .
ALEX: Why aren't you doing well in the class ?
BLAKE:  The material is so abstract that I have trouble understanding it .
ALEX: Reservation , can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I would like to reserve a room for next Monday .
ALEX:  Wait a moment , please . Let me check it .
BLAKE:  By the way , I want a large room .
ALEX:  Right now we have a suite for 4 people , do you want to book it ?
BLAKE:  Yes , that's what I am looking for . I will take the room for 2 days .
ALEX: Hey Mel ! Are you up for some tennis today ?
BLAKE:  Sorry , I can ’ t ! I have to go to work , pick up Jake and Maddie from school , and make them an afternoon snack , then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class .
ALEX:  You sound exhausted . Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out ! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities . She can also help you do some household chores , and run so
BLAKE:  Oh , I don ’ t know ... it ’ s hard to find the right nanny . You have to consider her previous work experience , the responsibilities you give her , and how she interacts with the kids . I would love to have
ALEX:  I think you should definitely consider it ! This way you won ’ t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ’ ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . I can refer you this great
BLAKE:  Oh , that ’ s great . Thanks Grace . Can you give me her number ? I ’ ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow . Maybe this way I won ’ t be so tired every day , and Dan and I might even get to go
ALEX: Can you tell that I ’ m excited ?
BLAKE:  What are you excited about ?
ALEX:  I voted today .
BLAKE:  Was this your first time ?
ALEX:  I just turned 18 a month ago .
BLAKE:  You ’ re lucky .
ALEX:  What do you mean ?
BLAKE:  Because you turned 18 in an election year .
ALEX:  I didn ’ t even think of that .
BLAKE:  You didn ’ t ?
ALEX:  I really didn ’ t , but I ’ m still excited .
BLAKE:  You should be , because you ’ re a part of history .
ALEX: Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I want to buy a pair of shoes .
ALEX:  Have you a pattern in your mind ?
BLAKE:  Well , maybe sneakers or rubber shoes .
ALEX:  Is there any special brand you would like ?
BLAKE:  Could I have look at that pair of canvas shoes ? They look nice .
ALEX: Look , how grand magnificent the Tiananmen Gate tour is !

ALEX:  I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out .
BLAKE:  Yes , I almost slid too.Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ?
ALEX:  Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .

ALEX:  There . Stop !

BLAKE:  That's very kind of you.How soon do you really need them ?
ALEX:  I'll need them for the conference on Monday afternoon.Do you think it can be done by then ?
BLAKE:  I'll try .
ALEX:  Thank you very much , Mr.James .
ALEX: Don't worry , your baby is in my home .
BLAKE:  How can I ever thank you ? I owe you a big favor .
ALEX: I'm very sorry , sir . My car has broken down .
BLAKE:  Sorry to hear that . Can we do anything about it ?
ALEX:  I'm afraid not .
BLAKE:  Then I have to call another taxi , or I'll be late .
ALEX: Hi . I need to have my shoes repaired .
BLAKE:  What ’ s the matter with them ?
ALEX:  Look at the heels . They are slanting .
BLAKE:  Ah , I can do it perfectly .
ALEX:  How much does it cost ?
BLAKE:  6 yuan . And I can make them as new as before .

BLAKE:  We have a great variety of Chinese antiques . Besides , we have landscape painting , figure painting and flower-and-bird painting .
ALEX:  I'd like a flower-and-bird painting .
BLAKE:  How about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? It was painted by a famous Chinese painter in King Dynasty .
ALEX:  Oh , they look just like live cranes .
BLAKE:  And what is more , in traditional Chinese thinking , cranes and pine trees symbolize longevity .

BLAKE:  Yes , it's $ 167 .

BLAKE:  It looks wonderful . Very authentic .
ALEX:  The chef trained in Florence . The pasta is very good here .
BLAKE:  OK . So , what can you recommend ?
ALEX:  Hum ... You should try the mushroom fettucine . It's really good .
BLAKE:  Is it salty ?
ALEX:  Not at all . It has a very delicate flavor .
BLAKE:  What does ' Duppa del Giono ' mean ? I'm sorry I don't know how to pronounce that .
ALEX:  Oh , that means soup of the day . I'll ask the waiter what they have today . Have you tried mussels cooked the Italian way ? They're really delicious .
BLAKE:  No . I'll try them . Sounds good .
ALEX: I am calling to ask about the position of an usher .
BLAKE:  Anything you would like to know ?
ALEX:  What qualities do you expect the applicants to have ?
BLAKE:  We expect the usher girl to be good-looking , no less than 165 centimeters high , and love smiling .
ALEX: Hello , ma ’ am , can I help you find something ?
BLAKE:  Yes , actually I ’ m looking to buy a camera .
ALEX:  We ’ Ve got a wide selection do you know if you ’ d like a point-and-shoot , or something a little fancier ? Are you shopping for yourself or for someone else ?
BLAKE:  Actually I ’ m buying a camera for my husband .
ALEX:  Ah , well then I ’ d recommend a nice entry-level digital SLR .
BLAKE:  Yeah ? Can I take a look at the Sirs you carry ?
ALEX:  Sure thing , follow me . This here is the .

ALEX:  No problem , ma ’ am .
ALEX: May I help you , ma'ma ?
BLAKE:  Please , where do I catch the plane for New York ?
ALEX:  First you must check in at Counter No . 4 .
BLAKE:  That one there ?
ALEX:  That's right . Then you will follow the signs to Gate 85 .
BLAKE:  Thank you . You ' Ve been very helpful .
ALEX: Mr . Crandall , I ’ m sorry , but I really don ’ t see the value in doing this entire project over from scratch . It would take a lot of work .
BLAKE:  That ’ s certainly true . But , that ’ s what this job is all about , Maria . There's no doubt that this project is unacceptable .
ALEX:  I agree . But I think that we can handle the problem by making a few major changes . I ’ d appreciate it if you would give me a chance .
BLAKE:  All right , Maria . I ’ ll give you until tomorrow at 4:00 to produce a satisfactory piece of work , but otherwise , you ’ ll have to re-do it .
ALEX: I think it's time for me to meet my admirer and make him face the music .
BLAKE:  You do ? How are you going to contact him ?

ALEX:  Thank you.How much is the fare to that stop ?
BLAKE:  One dollar .
ALEX:  How many stops are there ?
BLAKE:  Two stops after this one .
ALEX:  Could you please tell me when we get there ?
BLAKE:  Sure .
ALEX:  By the way , do I need a transfer again after No . 50 ?
BLAKE:  No , a No . 50 will take you right there .
ALEX:  Thank you .
ALEX: How are you wedding plans going ?
BLAKE:  Very well . We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . The only thing that isn ’ t ready yet is my wedding dress .
ALEX:  When will that be ready ?
BLAKE:  The dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks .
ALEX:  You ’ re getting married in three weeks . So that should be ok . So , you ’ Ve prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel-everything .
BLAKE:  Yes . We ’ Ve taken care of all of that . We decided not to get married in a church though . Neither of us is very religious .
ALEX:  Which hotel will the reception be held at ?
BLAKE:  The palace hotel they ’ re taking care of the catering , including the wedding cake . I ’ m sure they ’ ll do a good job .
ALEX:  Oh , yes . It ’ s and excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
BLAKE:  Yes . It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . It gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people .
ALEX:  I think you make the right decision .
ALEX: Have you any round-neck sweater ?
BLAKE:  Yes . Actually our range of sweaters is the most comprehensive available .

ALEX: So Dick , how about getting some coffee for tonight ?
BLAKE:  Coffee ? I don ’ t honestly like that kind of stuff .
ALEX:  Come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette .
BLAKE:  What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for .
ALEX:  Not for me , Dick .
ALEX: You guys are charging me $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw .
BLAKE:  Let's see , sir . According to your file , you watched ' Titanic ' Monday evening .
ALEX:  Well , the wrong information is in my file . I was at a concert Monday night .
BLAKE:  Well , your word overrules the file , sir . One moment , please .
ALEX:  I knew you'd see it my way .
BLAKE:  Sir , I deleted the $ 10 , but I had to add a $ 2 service charge to your bill .
ALEX:  Am I in the Twilight Zone ? You're charging me for a movie I never saw ?
BLAKE:  Please don't blame me , sir . Blame the computer programmer .
ALEX:  This is highway robbery . I've got a good mind to call the police !
BLAKE:  If it makes you feel any better , other guests feel the same way .
ALEX: Mr . Carter has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Shangri-La Hotel at 7:00 this evening . Here's an invitation for you .
BLAKE:  How nice of him . I'll be delighted to go . But what time would be convenient ?
ALEX:  If you could be ready by , say 6:30 o'clock , I'll be at the hotel to pick you up .
BLAKE:  That's great . It's most thoughtful of you to do this , Miss Rose .
ALEX:  It's my pleasure . Well , then . I'll say goodbye .
BLAKE:  Goodbye and see you tonight . Miss Rose .

BLAKE:  OK , I'll tell him .
ALEX: Good morning , sir . May I see your passport ?
BLAKE:  Yes , of course . Here it is .
ALEX:  Thank you . Are all these yours ?
BLAKE:  No , some of them are my friend's . Do you want her passport , too ?
ALEX:  Yes , please . Do you have any carry-on items ?
BLAKE:  Do you want me to put it on the belt , too ?
ALEX:  Yes , please . Would you please open this big suitcase ?
BLAKE:  OK . Just a moment . It's just some clothes and toiletries .
ALEX:  OK . Do you have anything to declare ?
BLAKE:  I think there is nothing .
ALEX:  Any fresh food , live plants , or animals ?
BLAKE:  Oh , no . None of that .
ALEX:  Thank you . You may lock up your suitcase . Here are your passports .
BLAKE:  Thanks a lot .
ALEX: Hello . I bought a China dress in your shop this morning .
BLAKE:  Yes ?
ALEX:  I bought it one size up by mistake .
BLAKE:  Oh , did you ?
ALEX:  I wonder if you can change it to one size down .
BLAKE:  Yes , of course.Will you come with the receipt ?
ALEX:  Then I'll come to your place later in the evening , and how late is your shop open ?
BLAKE:  Until 8 o'clock , ma'am . We are looking forward to seeing you .
ALEX: The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ?
BLAKE:  No idea . Your guess is as good as mine .
ALEX:  It better be more than last year .
BLAKE:  Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see .
ALEX: I'm going to go shopping for groceries in a little bit .
BLAKE:  Why , do we need groceries ?
ALEX:  I believe we are all out of food .
BLAKE:  Do you know what to get ?
ALEX:  I don't know what we need .
BLAKE:  Why don't you go and check the refrigerator ?
ALEX:  I would appreciate it if you would do that for me .
BLAKE:  Why don't you just get the basics ?
ALEX:  What do you mean ?
BLAKE:  Eggs , milk , bread . Things like that .
ALEX:  Go make that list .
BLAKE:  Sure , no problem .
ALEX: Hello , take a seat please . Let's get straight to the point . This is our contract . Please read it carefully before signing .
BLAKE:  Since we have reached an agreement on all terms , there shouldn't be any problems for the contract .
ALEX:  May we once more remind you that the contract should be canceled by one month notice .
BLAKE:  Yes , I got it . Thanks .
ALEX: Excuse me , is this the baggage claim area from KL17 ?
BLAKE:  Yes , can I help you ?
ALEX:  Well , this is my baggage claim tag . Can you get my baggage now ?
BLAKE:  OK , here you are .
ALEX:  Thanks a lot .
ALEX: Were you able to attend Friday night's basketball game ?
BLAKE:  I was unable to make it .
ALEX:  You should have been there . It was intense .
BLAKE:  Is that right . Who ended up winning ?
ALEX:  Our team was victorious .
BLAKE:  I wish I was free that night . I'm kind of mad that I didn't go .
ALEX:  It was a great game .
BLAKE:  What was the score at the end of the game ?
ALEX:  Our team won 101-98 .
BLAKE:  Sounds like it was a close game .
ALEX:  That's the reason it was such a great game .
BLAKE:  The next game , I will definitely be there .
ALEX: Have you ever tried shopping online ?
BLAKE:  No , never . I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes .
ALEX:  That's right . Seeing is believing .
BLAKE:  I've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement .
ALEX:  That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear .
BLAKE:  What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password .
ALEX:  It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough .
BLAKE:  I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping .
ALEX:  Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .
BLAKE:  That's a good idea .
ALEX: How long does it take to get to downtown from here ?
BLAKE:  It is 15 minutes ’ drive .
ALEX:  What companies do we have in our neighborhood ?
BLAKE:  Mitsubishi , HP , IBM and many other famous corporations .
ALEX:  Does the 7th floor belong to our company too ?
BLAKE:  Yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building .
ALEX:  It ’ s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ?
BLAKE:  Yes , at the end of the hall .
ALEX: Good morning , sir . May I help you ?
BLAKE:  Good morning , I have an appointment with Mr . Johnson at 10:00
ALEX:  Excuse me , sir , but are you Mr . Richard of World Trading Company ?
BLAKE:  Yes . That ’ s right .
ALEX:  I ’ m sorry , Mr . Richard . Mr . Johnson is on his way to the office . He had just called and asked you to wait a minute .
BLAKE:  Well , I ’ ll wait .
ALEX:  Would you like something to drink , sir ? Do you prefer coffee or tea ?
BLAKE:  Thank you . Coffee , please .
ALEX:  Here you are , Mr . Richard . This is the cream and this is the sugar . If there ’ s anything else you ’ d like , please don ’ t hesitate to tell me .
BLAKE:  Thank you very much .
ALEX: 911 . How may I help you ?
BLAKE:  I need to report a break-in .
ALEX:  When did this break-in occur ?
BLAKE:  Last night .
ALEX:  Where did the break-in happen ?
BLAKE:  It happened at my house .
ALEX:  Was anything taken ?
BLAKE:  I'm not sure yet .
ALEX:  What makes you think there was a break-in ?
BLAKE:  My front window was busted .
ALEX:  I'll send a squad car .
BLAKE:  Please hurry .
ALEX: Good morning , everyone . Let me introduce myself to you ...
BLAKE:  You don't need to introduce yourself , Yang . You're famous .
ALEX:  Well , thank you very much but I thought l'd try and chair the meeting by the rule — at least for a while .
BLAKE:  OK , OK !
ALEX:  Now , I'd like to get things under way . The main topic on today's agenda is the development of a U . S . sales strategy for the new EBB . I'd like to hear all of your ideas , Mr . Wall , you seem in top form today . Could you start the ball rolling ?
BLAKE:  Uh , oh , sure . Well , I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising .
ALEX:  Well , that's kind of obvious .
BLAKE:  Give me a break , Mr Yang .
ALEX:  Uh , let's keep this going , shall we ?
ALEX: I'm sorry , but I don't think this damage is our fault .
BLAKE:  What do you mean ?
ALEX:  It looks like the shipping company did this .
BLAKE:  We'd better take it up with them , in that case .
ALEX: I ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me , Mr . Johnson . I can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely !
BLAKE:  No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering .
ALEX:  Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining .
BLAKE:  Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ?
ALEX:  Actually , the factory is located in Scotland .
BLAKE:  Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
ALEX:  That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one !
BLAKE:  Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ...
ALEX:  Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection .
BLAKE:  Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ?
ALEX:  I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret . Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis .
BLAKE:  Haggis ? What ’ s Haggis ?
ALEX:  It ’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy , you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach .
BLAKE:  Ah , get back to you .
ALEX:  Mr . Johnson ? Mr . Johnson ?
ALEX: Do you need a guide ?
BLAKE:  Yes , we are just looking for one . What's the charge per day ?
ALEX:  It's $ 20 . If you are staying for more than 3 days in the city , the charge is $ 16 per day .
BLAKE:  That's reasonable .
ALEX: Aren't you Jim Green ?
BLAKE:  Yes , that's right .
ALEX:  I believe we met at a concert last year . I'm Taylor .
BLAKE:  Oh , yes . I remember .
ALEX: Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ?
BLAKE:  Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it .
ALEX:  I think I can handle it by myself .
BLAKE:  I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
ALEX:  I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
BLAKE:  Other company rules also need your attention .
ALEX:  Like this one ? Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder.Yeah , thank you for telling me .
BLAKE:  Don ’ t mention it .
ALEX: Thank God ! I am finished writing that service guide ! It took me forever !
BLAKE:  When did you finish ?
ALEX:  This morning ! No more overtime , and no more headaches !
BLAKE:  Well , I ’ m glad to hear it . Have a cup of coffee !
ALEX: I didn ’ t receive an unemployment check this week and need to know why .
BLAKE:  Did you mail us your last Continued Claim Form ?
ALEX:  I am afraid that I forgot to send it in .
BLAKE:  We cannot pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks .
ALEX:  Is it too late to mail the Continued Claim Form in now ?
BLAKE:  It can ’ t be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it .
ALEX:  I will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem .
BLAKE:  You can ’ t possibly know in advance how much you will be working . If you mail it in too soon , we will reject it !
ALEX:  Will my paycheck arrive late because I messed up on my form ?
BLAKE:  Your check will be arriving late , but the next one will come right on time .
ALEX: I should tell you that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes .
BLAKE:  I'm ready when you are , sir .
ALEX:  Very good ! Now , it's still morning here in New York .
BLAKE:  You are so right , sir . The clock just struck nine .
ALEX:  I'm going to spend some time exploring the city . What can I do with my luggage ?
BLAKE:  Sir , right here we have a storage site . Its only $ 5 an hour , but you need to leave a deposit .
ALEX:  A deposit ? Isn't my luggage a deposit ?
BLAKE:  I'm sorry , sir , but it isn't . Your MasterCard or VISA will take care of things nicely .
ALEX:  Okay . Let me think about this .
BLAKE:  Okay , sir . But don't take too long . You only have 30 minutes .
ALEX: May I take your order ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I'd like a cup of onion soup .
ALEX:  And what would you like after that ?
BLAKE:  I'd like the roast chicken , please .
ALEX: It's the latest and quite popular among young people .
BLAKE:  Yes , I know and I like it very much . I will take it .
ALEX:  Sure . Here is your receipt .
BLAKE:  How long is this cell phone guaranteed ?
ALEX:  You can refund it in 7 days and exchange it in one year .
ALEX: Hey honey , how was your day ?
BLAKE:  It was alright . I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while . He ’ s in a bit of a jam .
ALEX:  Why ? What happened ?
BLAKE:  Well , his son had an accident and Bill doesn ’ t have health insurance . This really got me thinking , and I wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different HMO ’ s .
ALEX:  Yeah , you ’ re right . We aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
BLAKE:  Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ’ s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too .
ALEX:  Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money .
BLAKE:  Well , we don ’ t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine .
ALEX:  I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
BLAKE:  Not in a million years !
ALEX: Hello . Can you tell me what the procedures of applying for a job are ?
BLAKE:  Yes , of course . There are many steps . You can apply for the job on the Internet and then send your resume to the e-mail address of the company . And wail the feedback of the company .
ALEX:  What is the qualification needed by the position ?
BLAKE:  You must have over 2 years'experience first .
ALEX: What did you do today ?
BLAKE:  Played poker with my work friends .
ALEX:  Did you win ?
BLAKE:  Of course .
ALEX: I'd like to withdraw some money from my account .
BLAKE:  Can I see your passbook and the withdrawal slip , please ?
ALEX:  Sure .
BLAKE:  Let me just make sure . You want to withdraw one thousand dollars ?
ALEX:  That's right .
ALEX: Can I have a look at that digital camera please ?
BLAKE:  Yes of course . This is a really good one actually .
ALEX:  How much does it cost ?
BLAKE:  This one is 1500 yuan .
ALEX:  It looks pretty good . I think I'll take it .
BLAKE:  Would you like anything else ?
ALEX:  That's all thank you .
ALEX: I need something to wash this down . Is there any juice in the fridge ?
BLAKE:  What is that ? It looks like something from a swamp !
ALEX:  It's a green drink . It's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals .
BLAKE:  You know , healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag .
ALEX:  The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins .
BLAKE:  Have you ever tried it ? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ?
ALEX:  It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day .
BLAKE:  It may take less time , but I don't know about easier . Yuck .
ALEX: Billy , you are late again .
BLAKE:  I'm sorry I'm late . I overslept . Is the manager here today ?
ALEX:  Yes he ' s in his office .
BLAKE:  Oh , I hope he didn't notice me .
ALEX:  Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you .
BLAKE:  You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ?
ALEX:  I think he might . You'd better go to his office .
BLAKE:  You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic .
ALEX:  Good luck !
ALEX: How much is the rent ?
BLAKE:  The rent is $ 1500 per month .
ALEX:  And how much is the deposit ?
BLAKE:  The deposit is $ 500 .
ALEX: Is there anything else , apart from the Credit Rating and Debt to Asset Ratio ?
BLAKE:  There is the Balance of Net Liabilities . This must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years .
ALEX:  Right , OK . That , again , shouldn't be a problem .
BLAKE:  And the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average , for that particular industry , for the first two quarters of the year .
ALEX:  Well , as far as I can tell , we qualify .
BLAKE:  Of course we will need proof , originals and duplicate of everything . As soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed .
ALEX: Do you understand any other foreign languages besides English ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I know a little about Japanese which is similar to Chinese not only in culture but in language itself .
ALEX:  What band did you pass in Japanese Language Proficiency Test ?
BLAKE:  I passed the Band two in LPT , but I will try to achieve Band one which is the highest level .
ALEX: What seems to the trouble Mr Brown ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m in pretty bad shape , Doctor Ford .

BLAKE:  That's right . A German company has invited me for business talks .
ALEX:  How long will you be staying ?
BLAKE:  Just two weeks .
ALEX:  How many pieces of baggage have you got ?
BLAKE:  Only one . In this case , I have a camera .
ALEX:  Do you intend to take it out on your departure ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I do .
ALEX:  According to the regulations , the camera you've brought along for personal use can be passed for the time being duty free , but you will have to take it out with you when you leave the country .
BLAKE:  I will .

ALEX:  Why ? anything special there ?
BLAKE:  It's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more .
ALEX:  Oh , really ? are there any snakes ?
BLAKE:  Snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .
ALEX:  That's terrific . I can't wait to check it out .
BLAKE:  Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?
ALEX:  Why not ? it's so cool .
BLAKE:  But it will pose a risk to your health .
ALEX:  Pardon ?
BLAKE:  I mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems .
ALEX:  Well , I didn't realize that .
BLAKE:  I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .
ALEX:  Oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .
BLAKE:  Yes , good luck , Maria .
ALEX: Hello , this is room 1205 . Our message lamp is flashing .

BLAKE:  I'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment .
ALEX:  Then I'll come down and pick up the message immediately .
BLAKE:  OK , we wait for you .
ALEX: guess what ? I've got great news !
BLAKE:  what is it ?
ALEX:  well , you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader , right ?
BLAKE:  yes .
ALEX:  well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him .
BLAKE:  really ? That's fantastic ! Will you get a chance to do any writing ?
ALEX:  she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back .
BLAKE:  wow ! That's really great news . How often does the magazine come out ?
ALEX:  it's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly .
BLAKE:  are you looking forward to doing more editing work ?
ALEX:  yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again !
BLAKE:  do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine ?
ALEX:  I don't have any with me , but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you .
BLAKE:  I'm really looking forward to reading your column .
ALEX:  me , too . Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ?
BLAKE:  sure , where would you like to go ?
ALEX:  perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop .
ALEX: have you seen the new Cosmo magazine that I was reading this morning ?
BLAKE:  I think I may have seen it on the kitchen table .
ALEX:  you're right , thanks . There's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that I want to finish .
BLAKE:  who's the director ?
ALEX:  it's Martin Scorsese . You liked his film , The Departed , didn't you ?
BLAKE:  yes , it was fantastic ! Can I read the article when you're finished ?
ALEX:  sure . You know it has an online edition , too . You should go online to read if you want to read it now .
BLAKE:  that's ok . I'll wait until you're finished . Just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ?
ALEX:  no . I don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile .
BLAKE:  how much does the magadize cost ?
ALEX:  it's almost three pounds now , and I think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon .
BLAKE:  that's quite expensive . Who is their target audience ?
ALEX:  Cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership , but I think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore .
BLAKE:  I bet you'll still buy it , though . You wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine !
ALEX: Wei ! This is a first-you didn't bargain !
BLAKE:  Bargain ? I'd feel way too guilty .
ALEX:  But you could have saved money .
BLAKE:  From a sweet ma ? ! It's not worth it . Plus , I'd happily pay more for these things I bought !
ALEX:  F . Y . I . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you're done ...
BLAKE:  Ha ! I'm just warming up ! Please take me there now !
ALEX: Can you help me do an internet search ?
BLAKE:  Sure . What do you want to find ?
ALEX:  I want to find information on the American Civil War .
BLAKE:  Well , can you be more specific ? There are a lot of websites about that .
ALEX:  Yes , I want to know about the battle of Gettysburg .
BLAKE:  O . K . Well , go to google.com , and type in “ Battle of Gettysburg . ”
ALEX:  Oh wow , there are a lot of sites .
BLAKE:  Here , try this one . It ’ s a good site about Gettysburg .
ALEX:  Thanks .
BLAKE:  For detailed information , however , you should read a history book .
ALEX:  Thanks . If I ’ m interested , I ’ ll go to the library .
ALEX: I just have to come up for air . I ’ Ve been here for too long a time .
BLAKE:  OK . You ’ d better come back in two hours .
ALEX: Good afternoon . I'd like to speak with Tom Smith .
BLAKE:  I'm afraid he's away from his desk at the moment .
ALEX:  Do you know when he will be back ?
BLAKE:  He's away on a business trip . He won't be back until some time next week .
ALEX:  Is there some way I can get into contact with him ?
BLAKE:  The best way to reach him is by cell phone . I'll give you his number .
ALEX:  Thanks . And could I have his e-mail , just in case I can't get him by phone ?
BLAKE:  Sure . His cell phone is 09112223 33 . And his e-mail is lower case t , smith--that's one word , at , c , c , w , dot , com , dot , t , w .
ALEX:  Thank you so much . Does he read his e-mails daily ?
BLAKE:  Yes . He usually replies immediately .
ALEX:  Great . Thanks again . You've been very helpful .
BLAKE:  My pleasure . I hope you get a hold of him .
ALEX: What seems to be the trouble , Mr . Brown ?
BLAKE:  I'm in pretty bad shape , Dr . Ford .
ALEX:  Oh , in what way ?
BLAKE:  No appetite , always on edge , and I can't sleep well .
ALEX:  Did you lose any weight ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I have lost quite a few pounds since last month .
ALEX:  When was the last time you had a check-up ?
BLAKE:  About two month ago .
ALEX:  Let me take your blood pressure . You look anemic .
BLAKE:  Well , Mr . Brown , I'm happy to say it's nothing serious .
ALEX:  You're just a little run-down from overwork .
BLAKE:  What am I supposed to do ?
ALEX:  I think all you need is just a vacation .
BLAKE:  Try to get outdoors more and be sure to get more rest .
ALEX:  Thank you , doctor . I'll do as you say .
ALEX: Good morning , Angela , how have you been lately ?
BLAKE:  Morning , Michael . I ’ Ve been very busy lately . One of our other vendors is going out of business and I ’ Ve been searching for a suitable replacement .
ALEX:  Well , rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run , sitdown.Coffee ?
BLAKE:  No , thanks . I ’ Ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine .
ALEX:  Haha , I could never do that . I ’ d be a zombie if I didn ’ t have my morning coffee fix . Let ’ s get down to business then .
BLAKE:  Yes . I ’ Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . The demand for phone cameras is growing , and Pear has been falling behind in the market .
ALEX:  That ’ s great ! I ’ m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . Is Pear still interested in having those ?
BLAKE:  No , we ’ re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
ALEX:  Surely . Let ’ s get started by drafting a new contract .
ALEX: Can I get my dress today ?
BLAKE:  You have ordered a red dress , is that right ?
ALEX:  Yes . Is that available now ?
BLAKE:  Yes , here you are . Try it in front of the mirror .
ALEX: Did you hear about the robbery ?
BLAKE:  Did I hear about it ? I saw it happen .
ALEX:  Are you serious ?
BLAKE:  I was there .
ALEX:  What happened ?
BLAKE:  A man came into the bank with a gun .
ALEX:  That's insane .
BLAKE:  I was so scared when I saw the gun .
ALEX:  Then what happened ?
BLAKE:  He took the money and tried to get away .
ALEX:  Did the cops show up in time ?
BLAKE:  He didn't even make it out the door .
ALEX: hello ! What are you reading about in the newspaper ?
BLAKE:  hello ! I was exhausted form studying , so I decided to read the newspaper to relax . Unfortunately , the news is so depressing . There has been another murder in the city center . I ’ m shocked that the pole
ALEX:  people are starting to get frightened by it . Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
BLAKE:  you mean if they catch the murderer . I ’ m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
ALEX:  there must have been some good news in the newspaper . I can ’ t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .
BLAKE:  well , there was one good piece of news . You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?
ALEX:  yes . Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
BLAKE:  well , they ’ Ve got the money and she ’ s going tomorrow for treatment .
ALEX:  I ’ m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that .
BLAKE:  I ’ m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I ’ m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I ’ m amazed that I haven ’ t even won a small prize yet . It ’ s so unfair !
ALEX:  don ’ t be moody ! I hope you ’ re not tired , because we ’ Ve been invited to a party this evening . I know how excited you get about parties .
ALEX: How much is it all together ?
BLAKE:  Let me see . The bell-bottom pants are $ 90 and the coat is $ 120 . It comes to $ 210 .
ALEX:  Is it possible for you to reduce the price ?
BLAKE:  I am sorry . It's a one-price shop .
ALEX: This is the Bell Captain's Desk . May I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I've been waiting for my bags to be sent up for the last half hour . Where are they ?
ALEX:  I'm very sorry to hear that . May I have your name and room number , please ?
BLAKE:  Yes , it's Yao Lan . Room 406 .
ALEX:  And how many pieces did you have ?
BLAKE:  Two suitcases and a handbag . The suitcases are blue and the shoulder bag is red .
ALEX:  Is there a name tag attached to them ?
BLAKE:  Yes , there is .
ALEX:  We're very sorry for the delay . I'll check immediately and call you back .
ALEX: Are you finished ?
BLAKE:  Yes.May I have some more beer ?
ALEX:  Oh , sure . I'll be back in a minute.Thank you for waiting . Here it is.Did you enjoy your meal ?
BLAKE:  Yes , the meal was very delicious and I enjoyed very much . I'm full .
ALEX:  Is that so ? I'm glad you enjoyed it .
BLAKE:  By the way , Miss.Where is the toilet ?
ALEX:  Toilets are in the rear . I'm afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment .
BLAKE:  What ?
ALEX: You look fresh recently.How do you make it ?
BLAKE:  I attend an aerobic class three times a week .
ALEX:  Aren't you tired ?
BLAKE:  No , I feel young , fresh and energetic .
ALEX: Hello , this is Liu Juan speaking . Is that Mr . Brown ?
BLAKE:  No , this isn't .
ALEX:  Could you please get him on the phone ?
BLAKE:  Sure . Wait a minute .
ALEX: It's especially cold when the wind is blowing .
BLAKE:  Why don't you wear a scarf ?
ALEX:  What can wearing one do for me ?
BLAKE:  You're cold because the wind is blowing into your open collar . It's not because your jacket isn't thick enough .
ALEX:  So wearing a scarf helps your body to stay warm inside your jacket .
BLAKE:  Yes . That's the secret to wearing a thin jacket .
ALEX:  You know , sometimes I can't feel my ears and fingers .
BLAKE:  I'll lend you my gloves and earmuffs until you get your own .
ALEX:  Thanks , Pam . You're my lifesaver .
ALEX: Hey , could you help me try and figure out how to get ready for my job interview ?
BLAKE:  The most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides . Do you know all about them ?
ALEX:  Yes , I pretty much understand the company .
BLAKE:  Well , after you've done your research , you have to decide whether the company is casual or formal . Have you decided what they are yet ?
ALEX:  Yes , I've been observing them .
BLAKE:  When you are choosing what to wear , keep all of that in mind . Have you chosen what to wear ?
ALEX:  I already have something to wear .
BLAKE:  I would always be ready to go shopping with you ! Should we talk about other basics ?
ALEX:  OK , I am ready to think of other things .

BLAKE:  Would you please show me that mural ?
ALEX:  Certainly . Here you are .
BLAKE:  It looks so beautiful . How much is it ?
ALEX:  Four hundred yuan .
BLAKE:  That's a bit more than I wanted to pay . Can you cut the price down a bit ?
ALEX:  I'm sorry . Ours is a fixed price shop and I can assure you this is the best price you can get for a mural like this .
BLAKE:  Maybe you are right . OK , I'll take it .
ALEX:  Well , I'll have it wrapped for you .
BLAKE:  Thank you . Here is four hundred yuan .
ALEX:  Thank you . Please come again .
ALEX: It ’ s so great to be here ! I ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home !
BLAKE:  We ’ re glad that you ’ re here . Would you like a tour of the house ?
ALEX:  That ’ d be great , but could I have a cup of tea first ?
BLAKE:  Sure , I ’ ll just go put the kettle on . Why don ’ t you have a seat on the sofa and I ’ ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
ALEX:  That would be lovely , thanks .
BLAKE:  Do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
ALEX:  I ’ ll take a little milk , but no sugar , please . Make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
BLAKE:  Ok . What do you think about our living room ?
ALEX:  Well , I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but I don ’ t really care for curtains . Did you get them at a yard sale ? They look ancient .
BLAKE:  My parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
ALEX:  Oh dear . Well , I suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? It seems a bit dusty in here .
BLAKE:  Your daughter usually does the dusting , and I do the vacuuming .
ALEX:  I see . Well , I can help with the chores while I ’ m here . You two could probably use my help .
BLAKE:  That ’ s very nice of you to offer . Here ’ s your tea . Be careful , it ’ s still quite hot .
ALEX: my lease ends next month , so I have to find a new place .
BLAKE:  I feel sorry for you . It's a jungle out there .
ALEX:  Do you know any places ?
BLAKE:  well . I guess I can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available .
ALEX:  thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet .
BLAKE:  how much do are you looking to spend ?
ALEX:  I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month .
BLAKE:  looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs .
ALEX:  it doesn't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route .
BLAKE:  anything you need to have in the place ?
ALEX:  I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side .
BLAKE:  you can also check out university bulletin boards .
ALEX:  why ? Will those be students who are leaving ?
BLAKE:  not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent .
ALEX:  thank you . I'll be sure to take a look .
BLAKE:  good luck .
ALEX: Good afternoon , how may I help you ?
BLAKE:  Hi , I'd like to order some flowers .

ALEX:  What kind of flowers would you like ?
BLAKE:  I don't know . I don't know too much about flowers . Can you recommend something ?
ALEX:  OK . What's the reason you are sending her flowers ?
BLAKE:  Today's her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her flowers .
ALEX:  Do you know what kind of flowers she likes ?
BLAKE:  I'm not sure . I know I should know that , but I can't remember right now .
ALEX:  Well , they're for your wife , so I think you should give her roses .
BLAKE:  Roses will be fine .
ALEX:  What color ?
BLAKE:  I think red would be nice .

BLAKE:  Can you deliver them , please ?
ALEX:  What's the address ?
BLAKE:  241 Main street .
ALEX: What do you think I should do , doctor ?

ALEX:  OK . Thanks a lot .
BLAKE:  That's nothing .
ALEX: What do you need today ?
BLAKE:  I need to take a few classes .
ALEX:  What kind of classes would you like to take ?
BLAKE:  How about a driver's course ?
ALEX:  Okay , you're going to need to make an appointment .
BLAKE:  I don't understand why I need to make an appointment .
ALEX:  You need to make one to come down and fill out your paperwork .
BLAKE:  I'd like to make one now if I could .
ALEX:  Sure you can ; when would you like to come in ?

BLAKE:  He's in bed , doctor . Can you see him , please ? He has a bad cold , too !
ALEX: Well , tell me something of yourself .
BLAKE:  What would you like to know , Mr . Green ?
ALEX:  What working experience have you get ?
BLAKE:  In 2004 , I got a job in the sales department of a trading company near Guangzhou . I started a sales representative . A year later , I was promoted to the position of sales manager . I had that job ever since , which is just over a year now .
ALEX:  Oh , good . Irene , can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant ? Don't you like your present job ?
BLAKE:  Frankly , some part of it I enjoy very much , but I prefer something more professional . It happens that I have a friend working here in this company . She told me the export department was to recruit an assistant . I felt very excited at this news . That's why I'm here .
ALEX: This looks wonderful , Madame Culot .
BLAKE:  Yes , it's very nice . All our foreign visitors enjoy it . The food is wonderfully well-prepared . Let me know if you need any help with the menu .
ALEX:  Thank you . Mmm . Can you tell me about the terrine ?
BLAKE:  Yes . A terrine is a kind of meat pate . It's meat turned into a paste . It sounds horrible but it's actually really good .
ALEX:  Mmm . Maybe another time .
BLAKE:  You could try the ravioli . They are rather like your Chinese dumplings , and the sauce is delicious .
ALEX:  Sounds good . I think I'll have the lamb for my main course . What does it come with ?
BLAKE:  Well , you can have fries-French fries-or simple boiled potatoes .
ALEX:  I'll have the potatoes . What are you having ?
BLAKE:  I'm having my usual . I like the fish here . Would you like some wine ?
ALEX:  Oh , yes . That would be lovely .
ALEX: Hi , could we have two orange juice smoothies ?
BLAKE:  Would you like those with yogurt ?
ALEX:  Sure , why not ?
BLAKE:  What else would you like to add ? We highly recommend caterpillar fungus .
ALEX:  Caterpillar fungus ? ! What the heck is that ?
BLAKE:  It ’ s a special kind of Chinese herb . It ’ s good for you !
ALEX: Wow , Amy , look at that number .
BLAKE:  What's so great about it ?
ALEX:  What do you mean ? It's a scrim .
BLAKE:  Not to me , I wouldn't be caught dead in that .
ALEX:  I love that kind of stuff .
BLAKE:  Yeah , you seem to like those styles .
ALEX:  Sure do . I get a kick out of looking punk .
BLAKE:  This one looks really expensive though .
ALEX:  I don't care how much it costs . I'm rolling in it .
BLAKE:  Lucky you ! I can't buy anything else . I'm flat broke .
ALEX:  I got a replace my party outfit , I trashed it last week .
BLAKE:  Why did you drag me into this ? I've spent a week salary .

BLAKE:  Just joking , Tonia . I've got some wonderful clothes . Let's go and have a close look at your outfit .
ALEX: I have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate . May I ask why I was defeated ?
BLAKE:  We have thought of you carefully with discretion , but the other candidate has more experiences .
ALEX:  Experience is important , but don't you think capability is more valuable than that ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I think so . But how do you prove to me that you are more capable ?
ALEX:  Maybe you can hire me on trial . If I'm not qualified for the job , you can let me go .
BLAKE:  Good idea .
ALEX: Excuse me , sir.Is there a barber near here ?
BLAKE:  Yes , the nearest one is at the third cross of this road .
ALEX:  I'm a stranger here.How can I get there , please ?
BLAKE:  Just walk down the road for a few minutes , and you'll find it on your right .
ALEX:  Thank you very much .
ALEX: Unfortunately , according to our regulations I have to confiscate these counterfeit notes .
BLAKE:  So , this 500 RIB is worthless ?
ALEX:  I'm sorry but it is our regulation , so I must follow it . We will issue you with a receipt to show that the notes you presented us with are counterfeit and have been confiscated . Then , if you wish to pay in some more cash , you are free to do so .
BLAKE:  Right , I see . Let me give you another 500 RIB .
ALEX:  Here's your Passbook back and the receipt to say we confiscated the 500 RIB worth of counterfeit notes .
BLAKE:  Thanks . Now can I make the full deposit ?
ALEX:  Yes . Please fill in a new deposit slip and we can continue .
ALEX: Ok , honey , time to take down the Christmas tree .
BLAKE:  Do we have to ?
ALEX:  Come on , it ’ s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging .
BLAKE:  It ’ s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . It gives the room a good atmosphere .
ALEX:  A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart , and it ’ s messing up the room .
BLAKE:  But it makes the place feel so much like Christmas . I ’ d really hate to have to take it down .
ALEX:  But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ’ s been there only because we ’ Ve been too busy to get rid of it .
BLAKE:  I know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away .
ALEX:  But it ’ s falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches .
BLAKE:  I know , I know . But it reminds me of the great Christmas we just had . All of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted .
ALEX:  Yeah , it was a good Christmas . It won ’ t always be this good , but we can ’ t make it last longer than it should .

ALEX: So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ...
BLAKE:  No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased .
ALEX:  How many people are on the board of directors ?
BLAKE:  Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line .
ALEX: How much will my pay be , if you don ’ t mind my asking ?
BLAKE:  We would like to start you off at 1,500 yuan a month , not including bonus and overtime pay . We don ’ t give bonus every month , but we offer a semi-annual bonus . And you will receive two weeks paid vacation a year , as well . Does it suit you ?
ALEX:  Yes , thank you . May I ask for an apartment ?
BLAKE:  No problem . We'll supply you with an apartment of two bedrooms and a living room .
ALEX: Mum , can I finish my homework later ?
BLAKE:  Sorry . You know the rules .
ALEX:  But I want to watch TV now .
BLAKE:  That ’ s out of the question .
ALEX:  Please .
BLAKE:  Not a chance .
ALEX:  Not even for an hour ?
BLAKE:  Sorry , it ’ s impossible .
ALEX: Where ’ s Sally , Jack ?
BLAKE:  She ’ s in the garden , Jane .
ALEX:  What ’ s she doing ?
BLAKE:  She ’ s sitting under the tree .
ALEX:  Is Tim in the garden , too ?
BLAKE:  Yes , he is . He ’ s climbing the tree .
ALEX:  I beg your pardon ? Who ’ s climbing the tree .
BLAKE:  Tim is .
ALEX:  What about the dog ?
BLAKE:  The dog ’ s in the garden , too . It ’ s running across the grass . It ’ s running after a cat .
ALEX: What's wrong with you ?
BLAKE:  I have a sore throat and headache .
ALEX:  Do you feel tired ?
BLAKE:  Yes , my whole body feels weak . And I really feel terrible .
ALEX:  I'm sorry to hear that . I'll have to examine you .
BLAKE:  Ok , go ahead .
ALEX:  Open your mouth and show me your tongue . Say ah ... You have a bad cold . So you must stay in bed for a week .
ALEX: Leo ! I wanted to tell you thanks for all your hard work on the budget . We ’ re having a get-together after work tonight at Carl ’ s Karaoke Club to celebrate having finished it . We ’ d love to see
BLAKE:  What fun ! Normally I ’ d love to , but I ’ m afraid I have to work late tonight . We ’ Ve got to get the contract ready for Miss King .
ALEX:  Oh , right . You ’ re busy with that contract . Maybe you could join us later ?
BLAKE:  Unfortunately , I just can ’ t make it this time . I have to go straight home . It ’ s my second wedding anniversary , and we ’ re supposed to be having a big dinner Susan would kill me if I missed it .
ALEX:  Happy anniversary ! Sorry you won ’ t be there . Maybe some other time ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , maybe . Thanks , anyway . Hope you guys have a great time !
ALEX: Excuse me . Do you mind if I try this on ?
BLAKE:  Not at all . The changing rooms are just this way .
ALEX:  Thanks . It's a little tight . Do you have any in a larger size ?
BLAKE:  Sure . I'll give you the next size up . That one is small , right ?
ALEX:  Yes . Also , I'm not so sure about the color .
BLAKE:  Well.It doesn't go with your skirt . I think the color itself is fine though .
ALEX: Are you going to vote ?
BLAKE:  Of course ! Are you ?
ALEX:  I plan to , but what day is the election ?
BLAKE:  You should know that .
ALEX:  Can you just tell me ?
BLAKE:  The election is this Tuesday .
ALEX:  Are you serious ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m not kidding .
ALEX:  It ’ s a good thing I asked you .
BLAKE:  That should ’ Ve been something you knew already .
ALEX:  I couldn ’ t remember .
BLAKE:  Whatever . Just make sure you go vote .
ALEX: Dave , there's something I want to talk to you about .
BLAKE:  Zina , why are you whispering ?
ALEX:  I've been talking to WebTracker . I'm thinking of jumping ship .
BLAKE:  What ? Are you serious ? You'd defect to our archrival ! ?
ALEX:  Keep your voice down . We'll talk more later . Right now I need to see Vince .
BLAKE:  We definitely have to talk , Zina . And watch your back . Elvin is still mad about his nose .
ALEX:  OK , but don't tell anyone what I said .
ALEX: You get your bus pass ?
BLAKE:  I'm not going to buy one .
ALEX:  You're not ?
BLAKE:  I think it's a waste of money .
ALEX:  It actually costs less if you have a bus pass .
BLAKE:  How is that ?
ALEX:  You can use it however many times you need to .
BLAKE:  Is that right ?
ALEX:  Yup , and you can keep the money in your pocket .
BLAKE:  That sounds nice .
ALEX:  You should go get yours .
BLAKE:  Yeah , I think I will .
ALEX: Good morning . Craftsman Company . Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes , good morning . This is Mr . Suzuki from Video TV . May I speak to Mr . Johnson ?
ALEX:  I'm sorry , but Mr . Johnson is out at the moment . Can I take a message ?
BLAKE:  Uh , yes , okay . Tell him John Suzuki called . That's S-U-Z-U-K-I .
ALEX:  Yes .
BLAKE:  From Video TV .
ALEX:  Yes , Video TV .
BLAKE:  Tell him I telephoned . I'd like to see him about the videotapes . Can he call me this afternoon ?
ALEX:  Yes , Of course . What's your telephone number ?
BLAKE:  It's , area code 413 , 447-9626 .
ALEX:  That is 413-447-9662 ?
BLAKE:  No , that's 447-9626 .
ALEX:  Oh , I'm sorry , 447-9626 .
BLAKE:  Yes , that's right . Extension 162 .
ALEX:  Extension 162 . Okay , Mr . Suzuki . I'll give him the message .
BLAKE:  Thank you . Good-bye .
ALEX:  Good-bye .
ALEX: It's quit a big cafeteria , isn't it ?
BLAKE:  Sure . I usually have my lunch here . The food is tasty and they offer a big variety .
ALEX:  Let's line up . The steak is very inviting . I'll have it .
BLAKE:  I'll have ham and egg with French fries . What dessert do you want ?
ALEX:  Banana pie .
BLAKE:  Where shall we sit ?
ALEX:  How about there ?
ALEX: Do you like cooking ?
BLAKE:  I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it.It gives me a real sense of satisfaction.Do you enjoy cooking ?
ALEX:  I don ’ t like it.It takes up too much time and I really hate having it clean up after the meal . I can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
BLAKE:  You can ask the guests for help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes .
ALEX:  So what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food .
BLAKE:  Italian , Indian and chinese . I ’ Ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and I need some more practice .
ALEX:  Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food ?
BLAKE:  Not at all.You can find most of them in supermarkets.The ingredients are usually the same as in Western food.The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients .
ALEX:  How long does it take you to cook a meal for 5 or 6 people ?
BLAKE:  Obviously , it depends on what I ’ m cooking.But I ’ d say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
ALEX: I'm searching for an old music box .
BLAKE:  You came to the right place . Any particular decade ?
ALEX:  If you had a box made in the ' 20s , that would be nice .
BLAKE:  We just got one in yesterday , so now we have six .
ALEX:  Would any of them have dancing figures ?
BLAKE:  Yes , we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures .
ALEX:  Oh , they're both so beautiful . Let me have this one , I think .
BLAKE:  That one truly is a beautiful piece of work , isn't it ?
ALEX:  One last question
BLAKE:  Oh , no . Everything we sell here is " as is . "
ALEX:  I guess I was asking for too much .
BLAKE:  If it breaks down , maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet .
ALEX: We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet !
BLAKE:  Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy . or a kitty !
ALEX:  Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
BLAKE:  I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard !
ALEX:  What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .
BLAKE:  Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ?
ALEX:  We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
BLAKE:  Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !
ALEX:  I ’ ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there .
BLAKE:  Yay !
ALEX: Over here is our gym . We have all the latest equipment .
BLAKE:  But I haven't used exercising equipment before . Can you tell us some more details ?
ALEX:  Certainly . We have here the race apparatus , stationary bike , muscle builder set , chest expander , bar bell , dumb bell and so on .
BLAKE:  Working in the gym is a very good way for losing weight . What else do you have ?
ALEX:  Here's the swimming pool . It's open from 10 a . m . to 11 p . m . There are also massage rooms here .
BLAKE:  That's wonderful ! I like swimming .
ALEX: John , I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year .
BLAKE:  I've already told my buddy , Mark , that I am going hunting with him in Alaska .
ALEX:  You can't be serious !
BLAKE:  Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you .
ALEX:  After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together .
BLAKE:  Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case .
ALEX:  You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all !
BLAKE:  Whatever you say !
ALEX: Have you declared your income and are you prepared to pay tax ?
BLAKE:  Not yet . I don't know how to fill out the form . What is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ?
ALEX:  I don't really know . Why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? They will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . He can even help you avoid paying tax legally .
BLAKE:  If I don't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ?
ALEX:  Certainly . No one who evades tax can escape from their detection.They ' ll check your income through computers . You'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . If you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined .
ALEX: What's up ? You sound a little down in dumps .
BLAKE:  I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn .
ALEX:  Calm down ! Shouting won ’ t help ?
BLAKE:  He is really outrageous .
ALEX:  What happened ?
BLAKE:  I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog , so I took a quick shower and went to bed . I couldn't fall asleep , because Brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . He shouted at me .
ALEX:  What ? He can't do this to you .
BLAKE:  Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know .
ALEX:  What did you do ?
BLAKE:  I shouted it back of course .
ALEX:  Hold it , Mike . You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? You worked it all up till now . Why not wait until you cool down a bit ?
BLAKE:  What would you do if you were in my shoes ?
ALEX:  Just stay cool . You know . When you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him .
BLAKE:  No way , Kate . I mean it's just not my fault .
ALEX:  I know . It wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . And after that , you can casually mention the problem . I am sure he will cooperate .
BLAKE:  I am too angry to do that .
ALEX: Excuse me . I am looking for a book called Little Women , but I can't find it anywhere .
BLAKE:  Let me see . I am sorry we just have sold it out .
ALEX:  Will you have it later ?
BLAKE:  I think so . Could I have you name , telephone number ? If we get one , I will call you .
ALEX:  That's terrific . Thank you .
ALEX: Who do you think is the greatest novelist in the history of English literature ?
BLAKE:  Charles Dickens.Actually no one can parallel him in writing .
ALEX:  I'm afraid I can't agree with you on that . I like D.H.Laurence ' s novels better .
ALEX: What game do you like ?
BLAKE:  I like board games . I like chinese chess and draughts .
ALEX:  I ’ Ve never played Chinese chess before , but I ’ Ve seen old men playing it in the street . It looks complicated .
BLAKE:  It ’ s about as complicated as chess . The basic rule and moves are simple enough , but there are many strategies that players need to learn .
ALEX:  I like playing cards . I ’ m pretty good at poker . Do you play cards ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling , like poker . If I did , I ’ d lose all my money .
ALEX:  Do you play bridge ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I do . It ’ s hard to find four players though , so I don ’ t play very often . Do you know anyone who plays ? If so , we could set up a game .
ALEX:  I can play quite well . I have a friend who likes playing , but she ’ s not very good at it . Shall I invite her to play ?
BLAKE:  Sure , I have a friend who play fairly well . We should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game .
ALEX:  I ’ ll call my friend now . you call yours .
ALEX: Can you give me more details on what is included in the package ?
BLAKE:  Sure . The coach leaves at 6:30 a . m . , in front of our office . The drive takes eight hours , with two stops to see some sights .
ALEX:  What about the hotel accommodations ?
BLAKE:  You'll be staying at Holiday Inn . It's a three-star hotel with two restaurants and a swimming pool .
ALEX:  Great . What types of things will we do at Lushun Falls ?
BLAKE:  The second day you take a four-hour city tour . In the afternoon you go on the famous boat cruise under the falls .
ALEX: Hello , 332440 .
BLAKE:  Oh hello , Sally . This is Dave Thomson here . Could I speak to Jim please ?
ALEX:  I'm afraid he's not in at the moment Dave . He went out about an hour ago and he's not back yet .
BLAKE:  Any idea when he might be back ?
ALEX:  Well , he shouldn't be long . He said he was just going to get some paint . But I wouldn't be surprised if he's stopped off at the pub on the way back .
BLAKE:  OK . well , tell him I've called , will you , and I'll try again later .
ALEX:  All right . Goodbye , Dave .
BLAKE:  Thanks then Sally . Goodbye .

BLAKE:  Alright , alright . I ’ m coming .
ALEX:  Ok , here ’ s a list of chores we need to get done . I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries for tonight . You can sweep and mop the floors . Oh , and the furniture needs to be dusted .
BLAKE:  You know what , I have to pick something up at the mall , so why don ’ t you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries .
ALEX:  Sure that ’ s fine . Here is the list of all the things you need to get . Don't forget anything ! And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home ?
BLAKE:  Hey , honey I ’ m back . Wow , the house looks really good !

BLAKE:  Just a sec I ’ m just gonna vacuum this rug real fast
ALEX:  Wait ! Don ’ t turn it on ...
ALEX: Good afternoon , welcome to IBA . How can I be of service ?
BLAKE:  I'd like to talk to somebody about the Group Account Deposit Service .
ALEX:  This refers to the deposit business offered to the level 1 account of group companies .
BLAKE:  What is it used for ? I mean , why bother to get this special account ?
ALEX:  Group companies can use this to make their arrangement of funds flexible , when dealing with their subsidiaries .
BLAKE:  I see , so this can really cut down on time and centralise management . Interesting ...
ALEX: Is this a duty-free shop ?
BLAKE:  Yes , sir . What can I do for you ?
ALEX:  I want to buy some specialties . Can you recommend me some ?
BLAKE:  Sure . I strongly advise you to buy a bottle of perfume and a lighter .

BLAKE:  How much is it ?
ALEX:  One thousand eight hundred yuan .
BLAKE:  It's not expensive . I'll take it .
ALEX: Oh , so Dalian is hotter than New York now .
BLAKE:  Not hot but warm . Very comfortable .
ALEX:  Are you staying at the Hilton ?

BLAKE:  Both of our two parties were involved in the discussion previously . Shall we also allow some of our clients to join us ?
ALEX:  Good idea ! In this way , our clients ' needs will be met and disagreements between the two parties avoided .
BLAKE:  Sounds like we have the same idea .
ALEX: Could you please tell me how I can go job-hunting in the web ?

ALEX:  How should I contact them ?
BLAKE:  You can e-mail your application materials for application to the websites of job agencies for enrollment in their database .
ALEX:  Can I get a quick reply from the sites ?
BLAKE:  Yes , usually it takes a short time , but you have to await the choice of the units for a while .

ALEX:  Thank you very much .
BLAKE:  Please make sure to fasten your seat belt . We are to take off .
ALEX: What do you think about this store ? I heard it ’ s a posh store that ’ s only got branches in big cities .
BLAKE:  I love this store . The only problem is that it ’ s extremely expensive .

BLAKE:  Yes , I can . I have received some special training in computers . Besides I am good at operating common office machines , such as fax machines and duplicating machines .
ALEX:  Sometimes we are very busy and need to work overtime . How do you feel about that ?
BLAKE:  That's all right . But could you tell me how often and how many hours I should work overtime ?
ALEX:  It just depends . If we have important visiting delegations , you have to stay with us . It's not unusual .
BLAKE:  Mr . Smith , I's like to ask you a question .
ALEX:  OK , please .
BLAKE:  What specific duties would I perform if I am hired ?

ALEX:  I also realized this issue . And office automation is essential .
BLAKE:  Besides , Internet tends to be more essential now in the information age .
ALEX:  Good idea . A network of work stations is helpful for our management .
BLAKE:  And , to be frank , our copying machines are too slow ; our telephone system is limited in function .
ALEX:  You are right . The current equipment of our offices really falls behind . Next week , you can provide me a catalogue of new equipment .
ALEX: Thank your for calling World Airline . What can I do for you ?
BLAKE:  I need to book a plane ticket to London .

BLAKE:  Thank you for noticing ! I've been making a few lifestyle changes over the past year .
ALEX:  Tell me about it . I'm interested .
BLAKE:  Well , it all started when my brother challenged me to quit smoking .

BLAKE:  Thank you for saying so . Have you seen the exhibition halls ? On display are most of our products , such as silk , woolen knitwear , cotton piece goods , and garments .
ALEX:  Oh , yes . I had a look yesterday . I found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I ’ Ve gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I ’ Ve got some idea of your exports . I ’ m interested in your silk blouses .

ALEX:  I need help with food .
BLAKE:  OK , well , let's coordinate our efforts . Should this party be formal or casual ?
ALEX:  I think it should be casual .
BLAKE:  I agree . Next , we have to decide on food . We have a choice of Chinese or Continental Cuisine . Which one should we have ?
ALEX:  I would prefer Chinese food for this party .
BLAKE:  Perfect choice . For music , should we have a live band or a DJ ?
ALEX:  I think we should hire a live band .
BLAKE:  OK then . Well , I will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on Friday .
ALEX: Good morning . Thank you for the interview .
BLAKE:  No problem . Now , do you prefer working with others or flying solo ?

ALEX:  I need job security .
BLAKE:  Would you be able to relocate ?
ALEX:  I am open to relocating .

ALEX:  I need at least 75,000 per year .

BLAKE:  You're looking for a multi though , right ?
ALEX:  That's right . Just a simple multi-vitamin that I can take every day .
BLAKE:  Okay . Then I recommend this one . It's made especially for men about your age .
ALEX:  Oh ! You took the guesswork right out of that one .
BLAKE:  That's my job ! Is there anything else I can assist you with ?
ALEX: I only want a little off the top and the sides and back to have clean lines .
BLAKE:  Okay . Is your hair naturally curly or is it a perm ?
ALEX:  It's natural . My friend told me you know how to work with curls .
BLAKE:  That's my specialty . Let me put this around your neck .
ALEX:  Do you have any product that controls frizz ?
BLAKE:  With the cut I'll give you , we will minimize a lot of that .
ALEX:  Thank you !
BLAKE:  And when we're done , I'll show you some great stuff to take care of the rest .

ALEX: Now please tell me something about your past work achievements .
BLAKE:  All right , madam . When I was sales manager at the Beijing Friendship Store . I succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 % and profit margins from 50 % to 80 % .
ALEX:  That is quite an achievement ! Do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
BLAKE:  I don't think so . I'll create further achievement in the future .
ALEX:  Have you received any honors ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I got the title of " Advance Worker " in 2006 .
ALEX:  Do you have any publications ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I wrote a thesis entitled " On Interpersonal Relations in the Socialist Market Economy " and it was published in China Daily .
ALEX: Hit ' em high , hit ' em low . Class of ' 93 — let's go !
BLAKE:  Hi there , everyone . We hope you're having a good night !
ALEX:  Wasn't that football game great ! I just knew we'd win !
BLAKE:  The night is young , folks . Get some food and mingle with those faces from yesterday .
ALEX:  Later we'll let you know who the King and Queen of the Reunion will be .
BLAKE:  But for now , the band is playing the songs from our senior year . Get out on that dance floor !
ALEX: Excuse me . Can you tell me how to get to City Hall ?
BLAKE:  Yes . Go to the next corner and turn left onto Center Street . Walk three blocks to Second Avenue and turn right . Walk two more blocks and you'll see City Hall on the left .
ALEX:  I'm sorry . I didn't follow you . Could you please repeat that ?
BLAKE:  Okay . First , go to the next corner and turn left onto Center Street .
ALEX:  Uh-huh .
BLAKE:  Then , walk three blocks to Second Avenue an turn right . Are you with me so far ?
ALEX:  Yes . I'm following you .
BLAKE:  Then , walk two more blocks an you ’ ll see City Hall on the left . Have you got all that ?
ALEX:  Yes . Now I've got it . Thank you very much .
ALEX: What's up ?
BLAKE:  Nothing much , what's going on ?
ALEX:  I'm having a party this Friday .
BLAKE:  Oh , really ? That's nice .
ALEX:  I wanted to see if you wanted to come .
BLAKE:  This Friday ? Sorry , I already have plans .
ALEX:  Doing what ?
BLAKE:  I'm going to dinner with my family .
ALEX:  I really wanted you to come , but I understand .
BLAKE:  Yeah , maybe next time .
ALEX:  I'll hold you to that .
BLAKE:  Sounds like a plan .
ALEX: I find that you spend little on handset charge every month . Have you any trick ?
BLAKE:  It's simple . You can use call transfer .
ALEX:  Is it so simple ?
BLAKE:  Sure . You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls .
ALEX:  It's true .
BLAKE:  Call transfer has many other advantages . When I am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , I also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call .
ALEX:  That's all ?
BLAKE:  In hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip-ment , so we must close our handsets . If you set call transfer , the problem will be solved .
ALEX: Are you doing anything tomorrow morning ? I'm wondering if you'd like to come to my office to discuss the new project .
BLAKE:  Tomorrow morning ? What about tomorrow afternoon ?
ALEX:  Then I'll see you in the afternoon .
BLAKE:  OK .
ALEX: Hello , I want to apply for the position of an usher in your restaurant .
BLAKE:  Welcome . One of your duties is to know the number of the customer and accept reservation .
ALEX:  What else do I need to do ?
BLAKE:  You inform the people in charge and let them reserve dinning tables for guests .
ALEX: I ’ m going to be moving out soon .
BLAKE:  You still have time on your lease .
ALEX:  There ’ s no way that I can stay here .
BLAKE:  That ’ s not going to be all right .
ALEX:  I don ’ t understand why .
BLAKE:  I ’ m going to have to keep your deposit
ALEX:  Why can ’ t I have it back ?
BLAKE:  Because you ’ re leaving before your lease is over .
ALEX:  You have to give it back to me .
BLAKE:  You ’ re not going to get it .
ALEX:  But I ’ m not able to live here anymore .
BLAKE:  I can ’ t help you with that .
ALEX: Can I have my check , please .
BLAKE:  Here it is . 350 Yuan all together .
ALEX:  May son adores my new hairstyle so I suppose it is worth it .
BLAKE:  Hearing you say that is a big reward for us . And here is the receipt .
ALEX:  Thank you .
BLAKE:  Wait ! Congratulations ! You are the lucky customer of our anniversary celebration .
ALEX:  Wow , it's surprising . So what do I get ?
BLAKE:  You can have a free facial and then make up free for you . Do you want it now ?
ALEX:  Probably not . Doing that will probably take another three hours which I can't afford now .
BLAKE:  Here is our number . Call us when you are ready to come .
ALEX:  You mean I should make an appointment ahead of time ?
BLAKE:  Yes .
ALEX:  Got it . Bye for now .
ALEX: Can I borrow this magazine from you ? It's really interesting and I can't put it down .
BLAKE:  I am sorry , but I can't lend it to you now , for I haven't finished reading it . If you don't mind , I can lend you some back numbers to you .
ALEX:  That would be very kind of you . By the way , is it a monthly magazine ?
BLAKE:  No , it is a fortnightly . So , you see , I can get the new one quite soon .
ALEX: Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I do . I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall . There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . You have to be very c
ALEX:  How often do you run your anti-virus program ?
BLAKE:  I usually run it every few days . It finds a virus about half the time .
ALEX:  Which anti-virus program would you recommend ?
BLAKE:  Have you tried this one ? It ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free .
ALEX:  That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ?
BLAKE:  Just a minute ... go to this one . I ’ ll send you an email with the line in it . It only takes a few minutes to download . Then you have to go through the set up procedures . But they are not complicated .
ALEX:  What do you use your computer for ?
BLAKE:  I use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . I don ’ t play many games on my computer , but I do a lot of work with photographs . Using a computer program , you
ALEX:  Computers are great , aren ’ t they ? I should download some programs and learn how to use them .
ALEX: A :: You must be Wily . It's nice to meet you .
BLAKE:  B :: Nice to meet you , Mr . Wilson .
ALEX:  A :: Tim , please . Please be seated .
BLAKE:  B :: Thank you .
ALEX:  A :: So , Wily , you have been with IBM for two years , ready for change ?
BLAKE:  B :: Well , I think I'm ready for new challenges .
ALEX: Hello . Could you have a taxi pick me up before 10:00 a . m . ?
BLAKE:  What is your address ?
ALEX:  I stay at No . 115 Fucking Road .
BLAKE:  OK , a taxi will be there by 9:30 .
ALEX:  What are your rates ?
BLAKE:  It is RIB 10 yuan initially and 2 yuan for each kilometer .
ALEX:  I have a lot of luggage . Will those fit in the taxi ?
BLAKE:  Take it easy . I'll send a larger to pick you up .
ALEX:  Thank you very much .
ALEX: Hello Mr Waterstone , what can I do for you today ?
BLAKE:  Hello , Becky . Well , you see , I have this thing here , called a Fixed Deposit Certificate , and I've just noticed the date on it .
ALEX:  Oh , I see . You have two choices here you can either redeem or renew .
BLAKE:  I think I'll redeem , if that's not a problem .
ALEX:  No problem at all , Mr Waterstone . Any preference as to how you want the money ?
BLAKE:  Anything you like , but not too many large notes . It's useful to have smaller notes .
ALEX:  Here we go , Mr Waterstone . Here's your money and your interest note .
BLAKE:  Yes , yes . Everything's fine . Thank you very much , Becky .
ALEX: What can I do for you , young man ?
BLAKE:  I need to rent three pairs of skates for the morning .
ALEX:  What sizes do you need ?
BLAKE:  One pair of 37 , and two pairs of 21 . One for me , and the other two for two kids .
ALEX:  Here you are . And here are three crash helmets .
BLAKE:  Thanks . Well , those two kids are beginners . What should I do about their safety ?
ALEX:  Well , there are a lot to do , but nothing to worry about . First , make sure they don't go far from the railings .
BLAKE:  Oh , yeah , maybe I should ask them just to walk along the railings .
ALEX:  That's a good idea . And remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings .
BLAKE:  OK . Anything else ?
ALEX:  Never go to the center of the lake . The ice there is too thin to skate on .
BLAKE:  Got it . Thanks for reminding me . And , are there any intensive training courses ?
ALEX: Excuse me sir . May I come in ?
BLAKE:  Mike , you're late again .
ALEX:  I'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so I
BLAKE:  Do you think I believe the story like that ?
ALEX:  But it's true .
BLAKE:  How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ?
ALEX:  That's coincident 。
BLAKE:  Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time 。
ALEX:  I promise I will .
BLAKE:  You'd better .
ALEX: Honey , I have something important to say .
BLAKE:  Something important ?
ALEX:  Yes . I have just booked two tickets .
BLAKE:  Tickets ? What tickets ?
ALEX:  Two air tickets .
BLAKE:  Air tickets ?
ALEX:  Yes . We will fly to Paris the day after tomorrow .
BLAKE:  We ? The day after tomorrow ? What are you talking about ?
ALEX:  Today is June 18 , isn ’ t it ?
BLAKE:  Yes . So ?
ALEX:  Think about it !
BLAKE:  Then it is June 20 the day after tomorrow .
ALEX:  Yes . Think about it carefully .
BLAKE:  Oh , come on . Tell me please . Why did you book tickets to Paris ?
ALEX:  Oh , honey ! Don ’ t you remember this important day to us ?
BLAKE:  Sorry .
ALEX:  It is our 10th wedding anniversary this June 20 .
BLAKE:  Our 10th wedding anniversary ?
ALEX:  Of course . You completely forgot it .
BLAKE:  Darling . I think you have made a mistake .
ALEX:  I have made a mistake ?
BLAKE:  Yes . We married on July 20 ten years ago .
ALEX:  July 20 ? But I think it should be June 20 .
BLAKE:  Yes . We had planned to marry on June 20 , but something happened , so we had to put off our wedding day .
ALEX:  Yes . I remember now . We put it off . I did make a mistake . But how shall we deal with the tickets ?
BLAKE:  Since you have booked . Then let ’ s celebrate our wedding anniversary before hand .
ALEX: Do you want some dessert ?
BLAKE:  No , thank you . Check , please .
ALEX:  Wait a moment . I will calculate it for you . Your bill comes to $ 36 .
BLAKE:  Here are $ 40 . Keep the change . That's my tip for you .
ALEX: Food is less expensive in a cafeteria , because you serve yourself .
BLAKE:  How to do it ?
ALEX:  Just pick up a tray , then put a knife , a fork , a spoon and a paper napkin on it and stand in the line .
BLAKE:  How long will it take to reach the buffet ?
ALEX:  Not long , because people rush for lunch .
BLAKE:  The line sure does move fast .
ALEX:  Tell the man behind the counter what you want .
BLAKE:  OK . I like that green vegetable but I don't know how to call it .
ALEX:  Just point to it if you don't know the name .
BLAKE:  All right .
ALEX: Hey , did you hear about Jessica's party this weekend ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , but I'm still waiting for my invitation .
ALEX:  Oh really ? She gave me mine earlier today .
BLAKE:  Well , she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today .
ALEX:  Yeah , so are you planning on going ?
BLAKE:  I think so . It sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun .
ALEX:  It really does , I can't wait .
BLAKE:  What time does the party start ?
ALEX:  It starts at 8 o'clock .
BLAKE:  Oh , well , how many people has she given invites to so far ?
ALEX:  I'm not sure , but I don't think she's given out that many .
BLAKE:  Well , hopefully she'll give me my invite later on today .
ALEX: After the financial crisis , many industries are in incredibly cloudy situations . How do you think about our company ?
BLAKE:  The outlook in the future is very positive . Because we have been in this field for hundreds of years and we know how to survive this crisis safely .
ALEX:  As the department I am applying for is expanding , I would like to contribute by effort .
BLAKE:  Great . Welcome to our company .
ALEX: Farmer's Pet Store .
BLAKE:  Can you please tell me where you are located ?
ALEX:  Sure , we are off Singing Road , close to the bank .
BLAKE:  Thank you , I know where that is .
ALEX: Hi , Bob , this is John Lin .
BLAKE:  Hello , John .
ALEX:  I'm with Hartford public relations . I'd like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services .
BLAKE:  How about tomorrow at 11 o'clock ?
ALEX: Hey , Tom , did you enjoy your lunch ?
BLAKE:  Oh , don't mention it . It was terrible .
ALEX:  What ' the matter ?
BLAKE:  The food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone .
ALEX:  I see . You simply can't blame the server for this .
BLAKE:  Yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district .
ALEX:  That's true .
BLAKE:  Anyway , how was your such , Catherine ?
ALEX:  It was good . I brought lunch from home today .
BLAKE:  You did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America .
ALEX:  Well , I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy .
BLAKE:  I guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat .
ALEX:  Yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , don't you ?
BLAKE:  You bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America .
ALEX:  Well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places .
BLAKE:  Seriously ?
ALEX:  Yeah , it's hard to believe but true .
ALEX: Have you seen this news article ? Apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online .
BLAKE:  Wow , that's really interesting . So who won ?
ALEX:  Well , the Great Wall of China , the Taj Mahal in India .
BLAKE:  I've been there ! It really is an amazing work of architecture and art . The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb , the walls are covered with gems and emeralds !
ALEX:  Cool ! Also amongst the winners is Petra , in Jordan , Mach Pitch in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico .
BLAKE:  Wait a minute ! It also says that the Christ Re-deemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders . I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator !
ALEX:  Well , let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year .
BLAKE:  Good idea !
ALEX: Hello , I'd like to reserve a hotel room .
BLAKE:  That should be no problem . May I have your full name , please ?
ALEX:  My name is John Sandals .
BLAKE:  Hello , Mr . Sandals . My name is Michelle . What days do you need that reservation , sir ?
ALEX:  I'm planning to visit New York from Friday , April 14 until Monday , April 17 .
BLAKE:  Our room rates recently went up . Is that okay with you , Mr . Sandals ?
ALEX:  How much per night are we talking about ?
BLAKE:  Each night will be $ 308 .
ALEX:  That price is perfectly acceptable .
BLAKE:  Wonderful ! Do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room ?
ALEX:  Nonsmoking , please .
BLAKE:  Next question , Is a queen-size bed okay ?
ALEX:  That sounds fine .
BLAKE:  Okay , Mr . Sandals . Your reservation is in our computer . All we need now is a phone number .
ALEX:  Certainly . My phone number is 626-555-1739 .
BLAKE:  Thank you , Mr . Sandals . We look forward to seeing you in New York !
ALEX: Good evening , Pizza House . This is Marty speaking.May I take your order ?
BLAKE:  Um yes . I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni , olives , and extra cheese .
ALEX:  We have a two-for-one special on large pizzas.Would you like a large pizza instead ?
BLAKE:  Sure , that sounds good .
ALEX:  Great ! Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ?
BLAKE:  No , make the second one with ham , pineapple and green peppers . Oh , and make it thin crust .
ALEX:  Okay , thin crust . Your total is $ 21.50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ’ s free !
BLAKE:  Perfect . Thank you . Bye ..
ALEX:  wait ! ! I need your address !
ALEX: Hello , Personal Banking . How may I help you ?
BLAKE:  Hi there . I'm calling about Personal Internet Banking , what details can you give me ?
ALEX:  Personal Internet Banking is a self service financial service that is based on the Internet . It can be used by both businesses and individuals . We offer an online payment service , Personal Net Banking , which includes services such as account transfers , personal foreign exchange trading . You can also get account management services , online bill payment , for household bills like gas and electricity ...
BLAKE:  That sounds good . At the moment I spend ages queuing at the post office to pay my bills .
ALEX: I was surprised to see how few people you have on-site . You provide a wide range of goods and services but have a very small workforce .
BLAKE:  It depends on the time of year . At peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . We also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . We run a very tight operation !
ALEX:  Do you handle the recruiting yourselves ?
BLAKE:  Sometimes we use a local employment agency . It depends on the job .
ALEX: Jeff , look at this listing ! It says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent , and it's only $ 700 per month . What do you think ?
BLAKE:  Well I think I can afford that apartment . But are pets allowed ?
ALEX:  Hmm ... let me look . Yes , it says it's a pet-friendly building .
BLAKE:  That's great . That means I can bring my cat , Mr . Twinkles . Where is the apartment located ?
ALEX:  It says it's located in the suburbs .
ALEX: What would you like to have for dinner ? Chicken or beef ?
BLAKE:  Chicken , please .
ALEX:  Good choice !
BLAKE:  What kind of drinks do you have ?
ALEX:  Well , we have all kinds of beverages in addition to fruit juices .
BLAKE:  In that case , let me have a glass of orange juice .
ALEX:  Anything else ?
BLAKE:  I would like to have some tea as well .
ALEX:  Another flight attendant is coming down the aisle with coffee and tea .
BLAKE:  I see .
ALEX: I'd like to apply for a credit card . Can you help me with my application ?
BLAKE:  I'd be glad to .
ALEX:  I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history . I just came to this country .
BLAKE:  Do you have an account with this bank ?
ALEX:  I'm afraid not .
BLAKE:  In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . That would help with your credit card application .
ALEX:  What is the interest rate on your card ?
BLAKE:  The annual charge rate is 9.5 % .
ALEX:  That's very expensive !
BLAKE:  Not really . The credit card is a revolving account . You only pay interest on what you owe .
ALEX:  How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ?
BLAKE:  You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized .
ALEX:  Does the card provide any other benefits ?
BLAKE:  You can also get a cash advance up to 1,000 dollars on this card .
ALEX: You're really fit , Paul . Do you exercise very much ?
BLAKE:  Well , I almost always get up very early , and I lift weights for an hour .
ALEX:  You're kidding !
BLAKE:  No . And then I often go Rollerblading .
ALEX:  Wow ! How often do you exercise like that ?
BLAKE:  About five times a week . What about you ?
ALEX:  Oh , I hardly ever exercise . I usually just watch TV in my free time . I guess I'm a real couch potato !
ALEX: I don't believe we've met .
BLAKE:  No , I don't think we have .
ALEX:  My name is Gao Run .
BLAKE:  How do you do ? My name is James Green .
ALEX:  Here's my name card .
BLAKE:  And here's mine .
ALEX:  It's nice to finally meet you .
BLAKE:  And I'm glad to meet you , too .
ALEX: Marketing Manager ’ s Office . Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Mr . Smith , please .
ALEX:  Sorry , he is out .
BLAKE:  What time do you expect him back then ?
ALEX:  Sorry , I am not sure . Can I take a message ?
BLAKE:  No , thanks . I will call back later .
ALEX:  That ’ s fine . Please call again later .
BLAKE:  OK . Thank you . Goodbye .
ALEX: Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I need some traveler's checks .
ALEX:  How much do you need ?
BLAKE:  Three thousand US dollars .
ALEX:  All right , can I have your passbook ?
BLAKE:  Yes , here you go .
ALEX:  What amounts do you want the checks in ?
BLAKE:  It's all the same to me .
ALEX:  Here you are .
BLAKE:  Thanks .
ALEX: The plumbing in my new apartment is not working .
BLAKE:  I need you to tell me what the problem is .
ALEX:  The bathroom sink is stopped up .
BLAKE:  Is the kitchen plumbing messed up also , or just the bathroom plumbing ?
ALEX:  Just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem .
BLAKE:  Did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ?
ALEX:  Everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago .
BLAKE:  Are you going to be home so I can come by and take a look at the problem ?
ALEX:  I am not sure if I will be home later .
BLAKE:  I will be coming by around 10 this morning . If you aren ’ t there , I ’ ll just use my key .
ALEX: Grand Theft Auto Three is awesome !
BLAKE:  It's more violent than TV news !
ALEX:  What time is it anyway ?
BLAKE:  Nine-thirty .
ALEX:  Oh , my God , three hours already ! I have to get the chores done !
BLAKE:  No time . That's their headlights in the window !
ALEX:  OK , emergency measures . Let's throw the dishes in the trash ! Two birds with one stone ...
BLAKE:  Little dude , your life is over !
ALEX:  No time to worry . We have to dispose of this evidence .
ALEX: How old is Keith ?
BLAKE:  He's 21 . How old is James ?
ALEX:  He's a year older than Keith , but he looks younger .
BLAKE:  How's your father ?
ALEX:  He's fine . He retired last week . It's a turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .
BLAKE:  He can spend more time with his grandchildren .
ALEX:  Oh , I don't think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
BLAKE:  So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea !
ALEX:  How do you want to spend your old age ?
BLAKE:  In the same way , probably .
ALEX: Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ?
BLAKE:  Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume .
ALEX:  But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ?
BLAKE:  Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume .
ALEX:  It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ?
BLAKE:  Well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer .
ALEX: Why not come over to work in my company ?
BLAKE:  I need to think it over .
ALEX:  Tell me what you need .
BLAKE:  All right . I'm prepared to , if the pay is reasonable .
ALEX: We are approaching the top of the mountain .
BLAKE:  What a beautiful view we have here .
ALEX:  Yes , you can have a bird's-eye view of the whole city .
BLAKE:  Wonderful . Will we have any free time there ?
ALEX:  Of course . We will stay there for half an hour and you can do your own business .
ALEX: what did you do last night ?
BLAKE:  I just stayed at home and watched TV .
ALEX:  did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ?
BLAKE:  yes , it was a very evenly matched game .
ALEX:  what were the results of the game ?
BLAKE:  it ended in a tie .
ALEX:  what was the actual score ?
BLAKE:  it was three all .
ALEX:  really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid .
BLAKE:  if Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won .
ALEX:  what happened ?
BLAKE:  their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway .
ALEX:  that explains it .
BLAKE:  how many more games are left this season ?
ALEX:  that was the last game before the playoffs .
BLAKE:  when do the playoffs start ?
ALEX:  in a few weeks . Are you planning on watching them ?
BLAKE:  of course ! I really love watching football games on TV .
ALEX:  Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together .
BLAKE:  sure , that would be great .
ALEX:  Ok , it's a date then !
ALEX: how are you ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m fine , thanks . Just trying to get adjusted . It ’ s hard to keep track of everything around here .
ALEX:  That ’ s for sure . You ’ re new , too , huh ?
BLAKE:  Yeah . I just got here a couple of days ago . How about you ?
ALEX: Excuse me . I bought this shirt yesterday , but I would like to refund it .
BLAKE:  Gave me the receipt , please .
ALEX:  Here is my receipt .
BLAKE:  What's wrong with it ?
ALEX:  It's too small for me to wear .
BLAKE:  Would you like another bigger one ?
ALEX:  No thanks . I want to have a refund .
BLAKE:  OK , here is your money .
ALEX: Oh , so many kinds of winter hats .
BLAKE:  What is your favorite color , miss ?
ALEX:  Red .
BLAKE:  Here you are.It ' s very attractive .
ALEX:  May I try it on ?
BLAKE:  Go ahead .
ALEX:  Is there a mirror around here ?
BLAKE:  Right over there .
ALEX:  Does it suit me ?
BLAKE:  Yes , you look very nice .
ALEX:  How much is it ?
BLAKE:  We're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax .
ALEX:  That's quite reasonable .
ALEX: What can I help you with ?
BLAKE:  May I ask you something ?
ALEX:  What's your question ?
BLAKE:  How many hours behind the wheel do I need ?
ALEX:  What do you need to take it for ?
BLAKE:  I'm trying to get my license .
ALEX:  You need six hours .
BLAKE:  Can I do all six hours in one day ?
ALEX:  You have to do it in three days .
BLAKE:  That's all I have to do ?
ALEX:  That's everything .
BLAKE:  Well , that's a relief .
ALEX: Excuse me , I have something to trouble you .
BLAKE:  Yes ? I'll be very glad if I could be of any help to you .
ALEX:  An hour ago , I bought this vase with my tourist .
BLAKE:  Oh , yes . I remember it clearly . Is there anything wrong with it ?
ALEX:  I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel .
BLAKE:  Oh , how awful ! Let me have a look , I'm terribly sorry . It was most thoughtless of me . Would you excuse me , please ?
ALEX:  Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes .
BLAKE:  It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ?
ALEX:  All right . Thank you .
BLAKE:  Just a minute , please . I won't be long . I'm sure this one is perfect . You may examine it carefully .
ALEX:  Oh , yes , it is . I'll take this one .
BLAKE:  I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you .
ALEX:  Well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing .
ALEX: Here you are . You left the medicine here .
BLAKE:  Sorry . I was too worried .
ALEX:  I firmly believe that you love your brother very much .
BLAKE:  Absolutely . By the way , do you sell any traditional Chinese medicine ?
ALEX:  Yes , we have some Chinese medicine for common cold .
BLAKE:  I heard Chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure .
ALEX:  It depends . It's true that you can take some for prevention .
ALEX: What kind of place shall we rent ?
BLAKE:  It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .
ALEX:  Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .
BLAKE:  Neither am I . So a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area ?
ALEX:  I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
BLAKE:  Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
ALEX:  Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
BLAKE:  How much do you think the rent will be ?
ALEX:  I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
ALEX: I have a terrible toothache .
BLAKE:  Which tooth is it ?
ALEX:  This one here .
BLAKE:  Ar , Yes . There ’ s a big cavity .
ALEX:  Can you fill it ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m afraid not . The tooth is too far gone . it'll have to be taken out .
ALEX:  Then I might as well have it done now .
BLAKE:  you ’ d better wait , the gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days .
ALEX: May I have a look at that vase , please ?
BLAKE:  Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan .
ALEX:  Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive .
BLAKE:  Really ? Even for such an excellent one ?
ALEX: Can you tell me the best way to look for an apartment ?
BLAKE:  The local newspaper has ads for housing .
ALEX:  Is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with ?
BLAKE:  Sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate .
ALEX:  What do landlords charge for rent ?
BLAKE:  Would you like an apartment for just yourself , or do you need it for two people ?
ALEX:  There are two of us , but we only need a one-bedroom apartment .
BLAKE:  You should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month .
ALEX:  I really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me .
BLAKE:  Sure , I ’ ll go look at apartments with you anytime you want .
ALEX: Excuse me , would you please do me a favor ?
BLAKE:  With pleasure .
ALEX:  I appreciate the building so much . I am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .
BLAKE:  No problem .
ALEX: The product's selling points is its advanced technoledge .
BLAKE:  Unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford .
ALEX:  Why is the price so high ?
BLAKE:  It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly .
ALEX:  Model of computers aren't compatible ?
BLAKE:  Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities .
ALEX:  Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable .
BLAKE:  But by then , the technology will be outdated .
ALEX:  True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge .
BLAKE:  That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable .
ALEX:  This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product .
BLAKE:  I guess you get what you pay for .
ALEX: What kind of permanent would you like to have ?
BLAKE:  what kinds do you have ?
ALEX:  Oh , yeah , It ’ s quite of variety . Regular , cold perm , straight perm , pink curl and form .
BLAKE:  Last time I tried a pink curl perm and form permanent . Set the wave a little loose than as usual , please .
ALEX: Hello ! How do I get more amenities ?
BLAKE:  I'm sorry , sir . I'm not sure I understand .
ALEX:  I'm talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo .
BLAKE:  Oh , I see . So , you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities .
ALEX:  No , no . I've got plenty left .
BLAKE:  Now I'm confused again ! What is the problem ?
ALEX:  What am I going to do about souvenirs ?
BLAKE:  Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs !
ALEX:  Yes , I've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs .
BLAKE:  Sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items , and as a guest you get a discount .
ALEX:  Please ! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs .
BLAKE:  I understand completely , sir . Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment .
ALEX: Excuse me . Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo ?
BLAKE:  Well , you can take the No . 36 bus from here , but then you have to walk about 30 minutes .
ALEX:  That doesn't sound too bad .
BLAKE:  Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo .
ALEX:  Maybe that's what I'll do . Thanks a lot .
BLAKE:  You're welcome .
ALEX: I'd like to order breakfast , please .
BLAKE:  What'd you like , madam ?
ALEX:  Two muffins and a cup of coffee.Will it take long ?
BLAKE:  No , just a few minutes .
ALEX: How are you ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m doing well .
ALEX:  How may I help you ?
BLAKE:  Could you cancel a check for me ?
ALEX:  What ’ s the problem ?
BLAKE:  I wrote the check out for way too much .
ALEX:  How much ?
BLAKE:  I wrote the check out for $ 150 .
ALEX:  What were you supposed to write it out for ?
BLAKE:  I was supposed to write the check out for $ 100 .
ALEX:  I ’ ll just cancel it for you right now .
BLAKE:  That ’ s great . You ’ re a lifesaver .
ALEX: Would you like to take a look at the menu , sir ?
BLAKE:  Yes . Thank you .
ALEX:  Would you care for a drink before you order ?
BLAKE:  A glass of Qingdao beer .
ALEX:  Yes , sir . I'll bring it over . Have you decided what you'd like , sir ?
BLAKE:  Will you make some recommendation ?
ALEX: I ’ m taking BA fright 123 to London . Can you tell me where the reporting desk is , please ?
BLAKE:  Yes , Madam . The reporting desk for the British Airway's flight to London is over there .
ALEX:  Thank you so much . Is this the desk for BA flight 123 to London ?
BLAKE:  Yes , this is the right desk . Have you any luggage ?
ALEX:  The suitcase , that ’ s all . Except my handbag . Of course .
BLAKE:  Would you please put you suitcase on the scales ? You needn ’ t weigh your handbag .
ALEX:  Is there a receipt ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I ’ ll attach your baggage receipt to your ticket .
ALEX:  What must I do next ?
BLAKE:  You must go to immigration to the departure lounge .
ALEX: It's time for bed .
BLAKE:  But I'm not sleepy , Mum . Can I stay and watch more TV ?
ALEX:  It's already half past eleven . You have school tomorrow . You'll sleepy all tomorrow , if you don't sleep well tonight .
BLAKE:  I know . But I promise I won't be sleepy tomorrow . I work really hard .
ALEX:  Don't you have the exams coming up soon ? I'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those .
BLAKE:  Oh , I nearly forgot the exams .
ALEX:  You do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . Am I right ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , I guess so . Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow .
ALEX:  An excellent idea . Work now and play later .
BLAKE:  I know you're right . School is more important than TV . Can I watch one more show , then go to bed .
ALEX:  No , now it's bedtime .
ALEX: Yes , madam ? Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Oh , yes , please . But you are just closing , aren't you ?
ALEX:  Well , yes , we are , madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes .
BLAKE:  I shall not keep you long then . It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week .
ALEX:  Last week , madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ?
BLAKE:  Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ?
ALEX:  That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ?
BLAKE:  Oh , you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale , a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them .
ALEX:  I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans .
BLAKE:  I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday .
ALEX:  Well , it's all new stock in the window now .
BLAKE:  May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ?
ALEX:  Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .
BLAKE:  Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ’ d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot .
ALEX:  Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price .
BLAKE:  Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color .
ALEX:  That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ’ s exactly what you are looking for .
BLAKE:  There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness , they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes , those are the ones .
ALEX: I've come to hear about your offer .
BLAKE:  We have the offer ready for you . Let me check . 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box , at 20,000 yuan ; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box , at 30,000 yuan ; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box , at 7 , 500 yuan , for shipment in June . The offer is valid for five days .
ALEX:  I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected .
BLAKE:  You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where .
ALEX:  I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies .
BLAKE:  But you must take the design and quality into consideration . You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with .
ALEX:  I agree that yours are of the top .
BLAKE:  Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ?
ALEX:  To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help .
BLAKE:  Impossible . How about 5 % off ?
ALEX:  Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable .
ALEX: So I'm on the fifth floor ? How come this hotel has no fourth floor .
BLAKE:  Four is an unlucky number here , Peter.Four sounds like death in Chinese.Hotels often have no fourth floor .
ALEX:  I see.Oh , I know what I wanted to ask.How much should I tip this guy ?
BLAKE:  People don't usually tip here , but you can.Fifty dollars should be more enough .
ALEX: Hello ! This is Ruby speaking from G . O . T . International Travel Agency . What can I do for you ?
BLAKE:  I ’ d like to make a reservation for my trip from Detroit to Beijing on April 13 on Trans Pacific Airline .
ALEX:  Do you want a single ticket or a round trip ticket ?
BLAKE:  I ’ d like to have a round trip ticket with a one-year open return .
ALEX:  Economy or Business Class ?
BLAKE:  Economy , please . How much is it ?
ALEX:  It will be $ 850 .
BLAKE:  Very good . Could I get an electronic ticket ? I ’ m always afraid of losing my tickets .
ALEX:  No problem . How do you wish to pay for it ?
BLAKE:  Bank of American card . The number is 6786 9182 12300 8657 .
ALEX:  Thank you ! Would you like an aisle seat or a window seat ?
BLAKE:  An aisle seat , please . I ’ m tall and need to get up and walk pretty often .
ALEX:  No problem . Your ticket is for Trans Pacific Flight 87 from Detroit to Beijing at 3 forty p . m . on April 13 . You will arrive at Beijing International Airport at six 35 p . m . on April 14 . Your electronic
BLAKE:  What time should I arrive at Detroit Airport ?
ALEX:  Please be at the airport two hours before your departure to check in . You also need to reconfirm your reservation with the airline at least 7 days prior to your departure .
BLAKE:  What happens if I can ’ t leave on April 13 ? Can I cancel my ticket or change the reservation to another date ?
ALEX:  Yes , you can , but you will have to pay a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation .
BLAKE:  That ’ s OK . What are the weight restrictions for checked baggage ?
ALEX:  On Trans Pacific international flights , each ticketed passenger is permitted a maximum of two checked bags with a maximum weight per checked bag of 70 pounds .
BLAKE:  That ’ s great ! I can have two bags checked for 70 pounds each . I think I ’ m all set . You ’ re really efficient . Thank you very much for your help .
ALEX:  Thank you for the compliment and for calling G . O . T . Travel Agency . Have a nice trip !
ALEX: I do want to meet with you and take a look at your catalogue . We ’ re redecorating and are going to add some things .
BLAKE:  Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out . I can come out anytime on Tuesday or Thursday of next week .
ALEX:  Let ’ s put it down for 1:15 on Thursday . We ’ ll definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .
BLAKE:  Fine . I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on Thursday .
ALEX: That looks graceful on you .
BLAKE:  Thank you.But it is too bright for me .
ALEX:  How about this brown one ?
BLAKE:  Let me try it on . I like that color .
ALEX:  Ok , i will get one for your.Here you are .
BLAKE:  But it is too loose.Do you have the smaller size ?
ALEX:  Sorry , it had been sold out .
BLAKE:  What a pity !
ALEX: I ’ d like to apply for a personal loan .
BLAKE:  How much would you like to borrow ?
ALEX:  A thousand dollars .
BLAKE:  Let me check with a credit manager . A record show your credit reading is quite high . I don't think you have any problems .
ALEX:  What ’ s the current interest rate ?
BLAKE:  Our monthly interest is 1.5 % of the outstanding balance . Would you please fill out the application the form ?
ALEX: And there's a little upside-down Dilbert on the underside .
BLAKE:  When you flip the tie up , he's right side up . Brilliant .
ALEX:  My dad will love this . He's a Dilbert fan .
BLAKE:  I wouldn't mind having one myself ...
ALEX:  Model it for me .
BLAKE:  OK !
ALEX:  Wow ! You look just as dorky as Dilbert !
ALEX: Welcome . What can I do for you , Madam ?
BLAKE:  I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ?
ALEX:  That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service .
BLAKE:  A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ?
ALEX:  A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle .
BLAKE:  But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you .
ALEX:  We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies .
BLAKE:  I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free .
ALEX: Hello .
BLAKE:  Hi . It ’ s Tony calling from the dentist ’ s office . Is Lily there ?
ALEX:  No , Lily is not here at the moment .
BLAKE:  Could you ask her to call me back when she gets in ?
ALEX:  Sure . What ’ s your number , please .
BLAKE:  519 367 8901 .
ALEX:  Thanks . And your name is Tony , right ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I ’ m Tony . Thank you very much .
ALEX:  You ’ re welcome . Bye .
BLAKE:  Bye .
ALEX: So what do you think of my new dress ?
BLAKE:  I think it's great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I've actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine's for a while now , but I wasn't sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment .
ALEX:  Um , ninety-five dollars ?
BLAKE:  Yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ?
ALEX:  I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique . I didn't know I could get it cheaper somewhere else .
BLAKE:  Of course ! Everything at Helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn't you shop around ?
ALEX:  I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive .
ALEX: Who gave my dog this cooked chicken bone ?
BLAKE:  I did . Why ?
ALEX:  Didn't you know dogs shouldn't eat cooked chicken bones because they're bad for their stomachs ?
BLAKE:  No , I didn't . I'm sorry . It won't happen again .
ALEX: Is it Fred's fault ?
BLAKE:  No , I don't suppose he's to blame.The man in the other car made a mistake .
ALEX:  But he's equally responsible because he tried to overtake you .
ALEX: In foreign trade , exporters have to adjust their product in a timely manner .
BLAKE:  How to adjust ?
ALEX:  Exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers ' needs , wants and likes .
BLAKE:  Ah , some products are successful at home , but not be popular overseas .
ALEX:  That's because the fashion , taste and social customs and so on vary considerably .
BLAKE:  Yes , sometimes the differences are great .
ALEX:  Well , we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product .
BLAKE:  We have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales .
ALEX: I hate doing the damn laundry .
BLAKE:  Watch your language .
ALEX: I want to buy three tickets . What's the entrance fee ?
BLAKE:  $ 10 per person .
ALEX:  Here are $ 30 . By the way , where can I find a guide ?
BLAKE:  Turn to the next window and they will help you find one .
ALEX:  Thanks a lot .
ALEX: Shall we share a taxi ?
BLAKE:  Where are you heading now ?
ALEX:  I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road.It is very close to your house .
BLAKE:  Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ?
ALEX:  That's the one .
BLAKE:  You mean we'll share the taxi ?
ALEX:  Yeah.If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper.Besides that your Chinese is better than mine.The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully .
BLAKE:  Well.Don ' t worry about it , I will be happy to share the taxi with you .
ALEX: Good morning.Are you Mr.Liu ?
BLAKE:  My name is Liu Lichi . How do you do ?
ALEX:  How do you do ? Please be seated , How is your trip here ?
BLAKE:  Quite good , I think . I came here by bus , and it took me about 15 minutes .
ALEX:  Oh , yes.How old are you ?
BLAKE:  Twenty .
ALEX:  Hum , still a student ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics .
ALEX:  What subjects are you studying ?
BLAKE:  English , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy .
ALEX:  Have you had any working experience .
BLAKE:  Well , I worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays .
ALEX:  What do you like to do in your spare time ?
BLAKE:  I like sports very much.Besides that , I also like working on a computer in my spare time .
ALEX:  How are your English and computer skills ?
BLAKE:  I have passed the CET - 4 and 6.As far as computer is concerned I can use the computer for word processing .
ALEX:  Okay . Mr.Liu , we'll inform you of the results within a week .
ALEX: That dress is very pretty . Why don ’ t you like it ?
BLAKE:  It ’ s too loud .
ALEX:  We ’ Ve been looking around for many hours.What on earth are you looking for ?
BLAKE:  Well , you know , those styles or colors don ’ t suit me .
ALEX:  What style do you want ?
BLAKE:  I want to buy a V-neck checked sweater , and it should be tight .
ALEX:  Oh , I see.How about the color ?
BLAKE:  Quiet color .
ALEX:  I know a shop selling this kind of sweaters .
BLAKE:  Really ? Let ’ s go there .
ALEX: Hey Julie , you want to go grab something to eat ?
BLAKE:  Sure ! What do you feel like having ?
ALEX:  I really feel like having a big juicy steak !
BLAKE:  Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ?
ALEX:  I didn't know you were a vegetarian !
BLAKE:  I'm not , I am a vegan .
ALEX:  A what ?
BLAKE:  A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood .
ALEX:  Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough !
BLAKE:  It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult .
ALEX: How do you feel about that restaurant ?
BLAKE:  It wasn't all that great .
ALEX:  What did you dislike the most ?
BLAKE:  I don't think that they had their act together . They didn't seem well prepared .
ALEX:  Did you think that the food was any good ?
BLAKE:  I wasn't all that impressed by the food .
ALEX:  The service certainly could have been better .
BLAKE:  The service did not help the situation .
ALEX:  Is this a restaurant that you want to come back to ?
BLAKE:  I am not interested in trying this restaurant again .
ALEX: Let me see your passport . Is London your final destination ?
BLAKE:  No . I am a transit passenger going to Sweden .
ALEX:  How long are you going to stay here ?
BLAKE:  Only one night .
ALEX:  Do you have any dutiable items ?
BLAKE:  No , I don't .
ALEX:  What are these ?
BLAKE:  They are my personal effects .
ALEX: I heard that you finished my home inspection , and I was wondering how it went .
BLAKE:  First of all , we need to understand what I was looking for . Do you know what the purpose of an inspection is ?
ALEX:  I am not sure what a home inspection is all about .
BLAKE:  I went there to check for problems with the home , so you aren ’ t surprised when you move in .
ALEX:  Wouldn ’ t the owners have told me about any problems ?
BLAKE:  Sellers aren ’ t always truthful , and there might also be problems that they aren ’ t aware of .
ALEX:  Can I require the owners to fix the problems ?
BLAKE:  You can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems .
ALEX:  What did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ?
BLAKE:  There were no major problems . One leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that I found .
ALEX: How you celebrate your Valentine ’ s Day with your wife ?
BLAKE:  I will take a rain check .
ALEX: Yesterday I had a quarrel with my roommate . I'm really fed up with all this .
BLAKE:  Tell me what seems to be the problem .
ALEX:  My roommate always brings a lot of friends from off-campus . They stay in the room until midnight , singing and talking , drinking and playing cards while I have no place for study . I even don't have the quietness to sleep .
BLAKE:  Did you ever talk to him about it ?
ALEX: What can I do for you today ?
BLAKE:  I have a question .
ALEX:  What do you need to know ?
BLAKE:  I need to take the driver's course . How many hours do I need ?
ALEX:  It depends on what you're trying to do with the completion of the course .
BLAKE:  I need to get my license .
ALEX:  You're going to need to complete six hours .
BLAKE:  How many hours a day can I do ?
ALEX:  You can do two hours a day for three days .
BLAKE:  That's all I need to do to finish ?
ALEX:  Yes , that's all you need to do .
BLAKE:  Thanks . I'll get back to you .
ALEX: Would you like your bags to be taken to your room ?
BLAKE:  Yes , please .
ALEX:  OK . I'll get the bellman to taka them up . Which bags are yours ?
BLAKE:  My luggage is in the corner over there . They are the leather suitcase , the canvass holdall and the blue backpack .
ALEX:  OK .
BLAKE:  Please be careful with the suitcase , it's very heavy .
ALEX:  I'll let the bellboy know . Don't worry , he's very strong .
BLAKE:  And the holdall has some fragile items inside , so please be careful with that too .
ALEX:  Of course .
ALEX: How far do we have to go ?
BLAKE:  About 50 miles .
ALEX:  The traffic is not very heavy on this high way , is it ? So I ’ m sure we ’ ll make it .
BLAKE:  No , but we ’ Ve got a hurry . It will be the rush hour soon .
ALEX:  Don ’ t worry . There ’ s plenty of time yet .
BLAKE:  But it ’ s Friday today . This road is always jam packed during the weekend , isn ’ t it ?
ALEX:  Right .
ALEX: Hello ! I'm sorry to bother you . This is a complimentary fruit tray . Your food will be ready soon .
BLAKE:  Wow ! It's a fruit sculpture ! Your chef is a real artist !
ALEX:  Actually , uh , I made it myself ...
BLAKE:  You did ? Wow ! Where did you learn ...
ALEX:  Sorry , but I've gotta run . Enjoy your food , and ring the service button if you need anything else !
ALEX: How can we develop a new brand image with no direction whatsoever ?
BLAKE:  With the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired .
ALEX:  I guess this is a good excuse to surf the Net on someone else's dime .
BLAKE:  Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic ?
ALEX:  He must have just got online for the first time last week . He still thinks it's some kind of new toy .
ALEX: Okay , so we're agreed on 900 .
BLAKE:  I'm happy with that price .
ALEX:  Let's shake on it .
BLAKE:  Okay , let's shake on it .
ALEX: May I help you ?
BLAKE:  Give me a Big Mac , a small order of French fries and a medium Coke .
ALEX:  You'll need to wait a few minutes for the fries . They are still in the fryer .
BLAKE:  That's fine .
ALEX:  Your total comes to $ 7 .
BLAKE:  Here's a twenty . Could you give me some more napkins ?
ALEX:  Sure . Your cash back is $ 13 . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes .
BLAKE:  Thanks .
ALEX: Let me tell you some more . The interest is settled on the 20th of the last month in each quarter , It's paid quarterly . Of course it also needs to be settled if you cancel the account .
BLAKE:  Miao Ping , in your opinion , should we go for the Type A or Type B Account ?
ALEX:  Well , the Type B Account is very restricted . If your aim is to use the account the same way as your use your Settlement Account , I would recommend the Type A Account for you .
BLAKE:  Thanks for your time . I'll go and discuss everything with my partner and I'll be back later .
ALEX: Sarah , you don't look so good . What's the matter ?
BLAKE:  I've got a really bad headache and my stomach hurts .
ALEX:  It sounds like you're coming down with something .
ALEX: Excuse me , could you give me change for a dollar ?
BLAKE:  I'll see what I have . What do you need it for ?
ALEX:  I want to get cigarettes .
BLAKE:  You can use quarters , dimes and nickels .
ALEX: Hi . I ’ m here to catch flight 513 to New York .
BLAKE:  May I see your ticket please ?
ALEX:  Here you are . Do you need to see my passport ?
BLAKE:  Any form of picture I . D . will do .
ALEX:  Mmmm ... a photo I . D . I have my New Jersey driver ’ s license . Is that ok ?
BLAKE:  That will do . What an interesting picture ! How old is it ?
ALEX:  Actually it wad taken just last year , but I had a shaved head and a beard . Can you still recognize me ?
BLAKE:  Barely . Will you be checking any luggage today ?
ALEX:  Yes , One suitcase . I also have a carry-on bag .

ALEX:  What was your major at university ?
BLAKE:  I studied economics , I am especially interested in the economic development of China .
ALEX:  What course did you like best ?
BLAKE:  I like Business Management , and i think it's very useful for the present work .
ALEX:  What do you think is the relationship between the subjects you've taken and the job you are seeking ?
BLAKE:  I've taken courses on office administration , reports and correspondence writing . I think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager , because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
ALEX: Marco has fallen off a ladder . I think he's hurt his back . What shall we do ?
BLAKE:  We'd better not move him . I'll get the first-aider .
ALEX: Have you ever shopped online ?
BLAKE:  Quite often . It is very convenient , saving me a lot of time .
ALEX:  Do you have some experiences to share with me ? I want to have a try .
BLAKE:  You are asking the right person . Here are two very important tips . First , you need to visit no more than one site to find the best products and prices . I can recommend you some online merchants . Second , write your mail address correctly . Otherwise , you can ’ t receive your delivery in time .
ALEX:  What about the registration procedure ? Is that complicated ?
BLAKE:  Not at all . You just need to provide your name , address , e-mail address , phone number and bank or credit card information . I will help you with that .
ALEX:  It is so nice of you .
ALEX: Hey , you look great ! how's everything ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit .
ALEX:  Really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work .
BLAKE:  It's important to do proper exercises .
ALEX:  You're right . Too much or too little won't do any good .
BLAKE:  The trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
ALEX:  Sounds reasonable .
BLAKE:  We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
ALEX:  And fruits !
BLAKE:  Surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .
ALEX:  I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can also help one to keep sound physical health .
ALEX:  I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .
BLAKE:  You bet it !
ALEX: What's your main range ?
BLAKE:  Generally speaking , we provide bikes for both gentlemen and ladies , size 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 and 27 inches . We can vary the colors according to the buyer's requirements . Here are the catalogues and the pattern books . They will give you a rough idea about our products .
ALEX:  I am interested in your flying pigeon bicycles . I think some of these items will find a ready market in Canada . But what our customers appreciate most is a reliable product .
BLAKE:  To be reliable is the strong point of our products . As a matter of fact , it's always our practice to supply high quality goods at reasonable prices . Flying pigeon is the best of its kind at the price .
ALEX:  Then I'd like to know your availability of the products and the terms of sales , such as mode of payment , delivery , discounts , etc .
ALEX: I have learnt how to ride a bicycle . I plan to go to the Water Park by bike this weekend .
BLAKE:  Well , you know , the traffic in Beijing is sometimes dangerous . Therefore , I have to remind you of something . First , you should obey the traffic rules , don't break in the red light . Second , don't play a joke with your friends when riding on the bike . Third , do not hurry up when riding , or would make an accident . Finally , remember come on the left and go on the right !
ALEX:  Oh , my dear sister , I am no longer a baby !
ALEX: You have a lovely house , Jack .
BLAKE:  Thank you . But a number of things have been going wrong lately .
ALEX:  That's too bad . What problems are you having .
BLAKE:  Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over .
ALEX:  I've studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ?
BLAKE:  Go right ahead .
ALEX:  Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room
BLAKE:  Wow , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions .
ALEX:  You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help .
ALEX: Hello , Mrs.White ! I'm Anne .

ALEX: I'm a little nervous .
BLAKE:  Don't worry . You'll be fine . First of all , put on your seat belt . Adjust the mirrors .
ALEX:  You don't think I'll need the seat belt , do you ?
BLAKE:  Of course not . But it's a good habit to put it on every time you drive .
ALEX:  Just in case , right ?
BLAKE:  Right . Hold the steering wheel with your hands at ten o'clock and two o'clock .

BLAKE:  This will be fine , thanks .
ALEX:  ( Handing her a menu ) Your waiter will be here in a minute to take your order .
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX: I have puzzled my brain about how to teach the children .
BLAKE:  What is your problem ?
ALEX:  My children can never be obedient even if I criticized them severely .
BLAKE:  You need not always do that . Why don ’ t you pat them on the back occasionally ?
ALEX: Can I have the window seat over there ?
BLAKE:  Sorry , sir . That table has been booked .
ALEX:  Well , in that case , this table is the only choice .
BLAKE:  Actually you can have a window seat if you don't mind a ten-minute wait .
ALEX:  There is no need . Thanks .
ALEX: I'm hungry .
BLAKE:  So am I .
ALEX:  Where should we go eat today ?
BLAKE:  How about we go eat in the cafeteria ?

ALEX: I am calling to find out why I didn ’ t receive an unemployment check this week .
BLAKE:  Did you send in your Continued Claim Form for the last period ?
ALEX:  I think I forgot to send it in !
BLAKE:  You need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid .
ALEX:  Can I send it in now ?
BLAKE:  You should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due . If it hasn ’ t been , we will still accept it .
ALEX:  Can I mail it in early next time so it isn ’ t late ?
BLAKE:  Actually , you cannot mail it in early , as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date .

ALEX:  Like what ?
BLAKE:  Oh , he wanted to know what time I got up this morning and if I bad a bath or a shower you know , things like that .
ALEX:  What on earth has that got to do with some money disappearing ?
BLAKE:  I've no idea . Oh yes , and the most ridiculous thing . He asked me what I had for breakfast this morning .
ALEX:  Oh well , that's it . They obviously think you're a desperate criminal and you have to steal to eat . I should think you'll get thirty years .

BLAKE:  What kind of deal ?
ALEX:  I'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car .
BLAKE:  You don't want your insurance company to pay for it ?
ALEX:  I'd rather not . They'll raise my rates . It'll cost me more in the long run .
BLAKE:  If you give me cash , do you care if I don't fix the car ?

ALEX: Good afternoon , sir . Have you made a reservation ?
BLAKE:  I am afraid not . Are there any vacant tables ?

BLAKE:  Let me help you .
ALEX: We have made some adjustment on the prices . And this is renewed price list .
BLAKE:  Thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side .
ALEX:  This is our rock-bottom price , and we can't make any further reduction .
BLAKE:  If so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks .
ALEX:  Then what ’ s your counter-offer ?
BLAKE:  This is our counter-offer .
ALEX:  We are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great .
BLAKE:  So are we . Our counter-offer is in line with the world market .
ALEX:  How about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ?
BLAKE:  Agreed .
ALEX: What do you usually have for breakfast ? Pancakes or waffles ?
BLAKE:  I usually have cereal for breakfast .
ALEX:  But isn't it served with cold milk ?
BLAKE:  Yeah . Cold milk wakes me up .
ALEX:  Chinese people don't like to eat cold food .
BLAKE:  Is that right ?
ALEX:  But I'm open to new things . I'll have a bowl of cereal , too .
BLAKE:  With cold milk ?
ALEX:  With cold milk !
ALEX: I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season .
BLAKE:  That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
ALEX:  It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
BLAKE:  That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it .
ALEX:  Certainly .
ALEX: Hi , I need to copy something right now .
BLAKE:  Our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine , sir .
ALEX:  Great ! How much per copy ?
BLAKE:  Sir , one copy is ten cents .
ALEX:  Okay , I'll be down there shortly .
BLAKE:  You probably won't have to wait for anyone , sir .
ALEX: Hi , Ellen . That outfit looks terrific !
BLAKE:  Thanks , Jim . I didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that .
ALEX:  No , we just don ’ t usually admit it !
BLAKE:  Well , thanks for the compliment anyway !
ALEX: This Olympic park is so big !
BLAKE:  Yes . Now we are in the Olympic stadium , the center of this park .
ALEX:  Splendid ! When is it gonna be finished ?
BLAKE:  The whole stadium is to be finished this June .
ALEX:  How many seats are there in the stand ?
BLAKE:  Oh , there are 5000 seats in total .
ALEX:  I didn ’ t know it would be so big !
BLAKE:  It is ! Look there , those are the tracks . And the jumping pit is over there .
ALEX:  Ah ... I see . Hey , look the sign here , No climbing .
BLAKE:  We put many signs with English translations for foreign visitors .
ALEX: It's located in the suburbs ? Well even though that sounds like a steal , I really want something downtown .
BLAKE:  OK . Well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive .
ALEX:  I know , that's my problem . What do you think I should do ?
BLAKE:  Well , maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate .
ALEX:  Oh , great idea !
ALEX: So , Monica , how do you like your new office ?
BLAKE:  Well , I love it . The room is spacious and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place !
ALEX:  That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
BLAKE:  What was so bad about it ?
ALEX:  Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
BLAKE:  Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ’ t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
ALEX:  Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
ALEX: Now , if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ?
BLAKE:  Yes , that ’ s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 .
ALEX:  Yes , I ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction .
BLAKE:  Yes that ’ s right . I ’ Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed academically .
ALEX:  Well , it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca . So how about extracurricular activities at University ?
BLAKE:  Well I ’ Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student magazine , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York .
ALEX:  What did that involve ?
BLAKE:  Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
ALEX:  I ’ m sure . Okay , now let ’ s move on to your work experience , shall we ?
BLAKE:  Yes , okay .
ALEX: Could you change these for me , please ?
BLAKE:  What would you like ?
ALEX:  Twenties and some smaller bills , please .
BLAKE:  Anything else ?
ALEX:  Yes . Could you tell many balance ? Here's account number .
ALEX: Now , what seems to be the trouble ?
BLAKE:  It's nothing serious . But I always have a headache , and I haven't slept properly for several weeks . I've also lost appetite and my eyes are burning .
ALEX:  Mm , you do look rather pale . Let me take your temperature . Would you put the thermometer under your arm , please ? Now , let me listen to your pulse . Mm , do you feel weak ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I never seem to have any energy .
ALEX:  I'll give you a blood test . Would you roll up your sleeve ? Just as I thought . You're anemic . You'd better pay more attention to your diet . Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . And don't stay up late working . Try to get more rest .
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX: Excuse me , I would like to know something about this campus . Right now it seems very big and confusing ! I have no idea where I am going or what I am doing .
BLAKE:  Do you have a map of the campus ?
ALEX:  Yes , I have , but it doesn ’ t help me very much . I ’ m not very good at reading maps .
BLAKE:  Do you know where your classes are ?
ALEX:  More or less . I go to three different buildings , and always get there late . I feel so hopeless . I don ’ t know why I am late all the time . No one else seems to be .
BLAKE:  That's because you don't know the short cuts . You'll learn them after a while . I can show you the ropes .
ALEX: Good morning , I would like to reserve a berth .
BLAKE:  Which train do you like ?
ALEX:  T112 to Washington please .
BLAKE:  May I have your name ?
ALEX:  That's Lincoln .
ALEX: Will you be voting ?
BLAKE:  I can ’ t wait to vote .
ALEX:  Who are you voting for ?
BLAKE:  The person I ’ m voting for is the best .
ALEX:  What do you like about him ?
BLAKE:  He is very intelligent .
ALEX:  You think so ?
BLAKE:  That ’ s right . Plus , I agree with his policies .
ALEX:  I ’ m glad to hear that you are so excited .
BLAKE:  I ’ m voting for the next President .
ALEX:  I ’ m sure he will be .
BLAKE:  I ’ m going to make sure and vote .
ALEX: Good morning . May I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I'd like to check out now . My name's Adams , room 312 . Here's the key .
ALEX:  One moment , please , sir . ... Here's your bill . Would you like to check and see if the amount is correct ?
BLAKE:  What's the 14 pounds for ?
ALEX:  That's for the phone calls you made from your room .
BLAKE:  Can I pay with traveller's cheques ?
ALEX:  Certainly . May I have your passport , please ?
BLAKE:  Here you are .
ALEX:  Could you sign each cheque here for me ?
BLAKE:  Sure .
ALEX:  Here are your receipt and your change , sir . Thank you .
BLAKE:  Thank you . Goodbye .
ALEX: What type of people do you work with most effectively ?
BLAKE:  I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive .
ALEX:  What things impress you in your colleagues ?
BLAKE:  I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment .
ALEX:  What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ?
BLAKE:  The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior .
ALEX:  How do you organize and plan for major projects ?
BLAKE:  I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a timetable that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react .
ALEX:  Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure .
BLAKE:  I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me.Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed .
ALEX:  How do you manage your time in a typical day ?
BLAKE:  I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value.The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week .
ALEX:  Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion .
BLAKE:  I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings .
ALEX: Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth !
ALEX:  I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better .
BLAKE:  Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards .
ALEX:  It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case .
ALEX: I am sorry to have kept all of you waiting . I was delayed by something urgent .
BLAKE:  You are not late , Mr . Thomas . There're still 15 minutes to go . Mr . White has just called you .
ALEX:  What did he say ?
BLAKE:  He said there was a traffic jam , but he is coming .
ALEX:  He shouldn't drive his car . He should come here by bus .
ALEX: Want to send out for some Chinese ?
BLAKE:  Some what ?
ALEX:  Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat .
BLAKE:  No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?
ALEX:  Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like .
BLAKE:  Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?
ALEX:  Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered .
BLAKE:  What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste .
ALEX:  Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag .
ALEX: Do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us ?
BLAKE:  I know something about it . Our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills .
ALEX:  It takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures , so I can not bear it anymore . It is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills .
BLAKE:  Is that true ?
ALEX:  Definitely !
BLAKE:  If that information is exact , I guess our company is willing to promote someone .
ALEX: Hello sir , how may I help you ?
BLAKE:  I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice .
ALEX:  I see , may I ask what the occasion is ?
BLAKE:  It ’ s not really an occasion , it ’ s more like I ’ m sorry .
ALEX:  Very well.This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
BLAKE:  I think I ’ m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ?
ALEX:  Mmm , well this is our I ’ m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
BLAKE:  I don ’ t think that ’ s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better !
ALEX:  I ’ m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ?
BLAKE:  Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .
ALEX:  Get out of my store , you jerk !
ALEX: I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights ?
BLAKE:  I'm very sorry , sir . I could put you on a waiting list , but you would be wise to check out other means of travel .
ALEX:  You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ?
BLAKE:  I have not sir . But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here .
ALEX:  Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well .
BLAKE:  Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list .
ALEX:  How many people are on the waiting list right now ?
BLAKE:  Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list . And you are number 176 .
ALEX: How do you think they could be ended ?
BLAKE:  I don't think that there is any easy way . The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate .
ALEX:  So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer.If the problem is resources , share them .
BLAKE:  It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it's harder to make peace between countries .
ALEX:  Yes , it is.One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive .
ALEX: You still have not given me those files I ’ Ve asked you for .
BLAKE:  I ’ m sorry , Mr . Myers . I ’ Ve just been so busy today .
ALEX:  I really don ’ t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ’ re running a busy office here . You ’ re going to have to keep up .
BLAKE:  You ’ re right , sir . I apologize . I ’ ll get those files for you now .
ALEX: What sort of job would you like to take ?
BLAKE:  I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator .
ALEX:  We need an operator now .
BLAKE:  It's just the job I've been searching for .
ALEX: I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past .
BLAKE:  I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process .
ALEX:  And it takes up all the news .
BLAKE:  The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up .
ALEX:  It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public .
BLAKE:  Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio .
ALEX:  I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio .
BLAKE:  Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line .
ALEX: Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ?
BLAKE:  I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ?
ALEX:  Sure . No problem .
BLAKE:  Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ?
ALEX:  Sure . Do you have my number ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this .
ALEX:  No problem . I'll wait for your call .
ALEX: What are you typing there ?
BLAKE:  I'm working on my resume .
ALEX:  Really ? Did you find any information about a new job ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , I just got some good information off the internet .
ALEX:  Great ! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job ?
BLAKE:  I didn ’ t just find out about one job . There were several ones that looked good .
ALEX:  Maybe I should try looking on the web for work .
BLAKE:  Sure you have to be patient . But I think it ’ s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls .
ALEX:  But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . You might have no chance .
BLAKE:  How do you know if you don ’ t have a try ?
ALEX: Would you please show me the necklace in the window ?
BLAKE:  Is this the one you want ?
ALEX:  No , the one next to it .
BLAKE:  Here you are .
ALEX:  Thanks . What kind of stone is this ?
BLAKE:  It's a ruby . It is from South Africa . Would you like to try it on ?
ALEX:  Yes , please . How much is it ?
BLAKE:  It costs $ 200 .
ALEX:  It looks good . OK . I'll take it .
ALEX: Happy birthday , Jim !
BLAKE:  Thank you , Lisa .
ALEX:  Here is a present for you . I hope you like it .
BLAKE:  Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time .
ALEX:  I'm very glad to hear that .
BLAKE:  Come here , let me introduce some friends to you .
ALEX: What's wrong with you ? You look pale .
BLAKE:  I'm not sure , I feel hot and cold .
ALEX:  When did the trouble start ?
BLAKE:  I was sick most of the night .
ALEX:  It sounds like you are coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature .
BLAKE:  Have I got a high fever ?
ALEX:  Yes , thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I have .
ALEX:  Now , let me have a look at you . I'd like to listen to your chest . Now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it Cough , now again . I want to examine your throat , too . Open wide , say ' Ah - - '
BLAKE:  Aaaaahh , aaaaahh .
ALEX:  Yes , it does look a bit sore . Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests .
BLAKE:  All right , thanks .
ALEX:  The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection .
BLAKE:  What shall I do today ?
ALEX:  I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . Take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . Drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . Here's the prescription .
ALEX: I have to check out today . I'd like my bill ready by 10 this morning .
BLAKE:  You can be sure of that , sir .
ALEX:  Thank you .
ALEX: I called HP about my computer .
BLAKE:  What did they say ?
ALEX:  They said I need a new hard drive .
BLAKE:  That's too bad . How much is a new one ?
ALEX:  It's not too much , only about $ 85 .
BLAKE:  Plus installation ?
ALEX:  No , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace .
BLAKE:  Really ?
ALEX:  Yes , it's just a couple of screws .
BLAKE:  That's nice .
ALEX:  It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 .
BLAKE:  If my hard drive crashes , I'll just call you .
ALEX: Gosh , it's 7:30 , I'll miss the first class .
BLAKE:  Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night .
ALEX:  Yes , Mum .
ALEX: Is there anything wrong ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college .
ALEX:  Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager .
BLAKE:  I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything .
ALEX:  You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision .
BLAKE:  But I just want to give her some tips .
ALEX:  Oh , she can make her own decisions .
BLAKE:  I guess you are right .
ALEX:  Believe me . Everything will be ok .
BLAKE:  I hope so .
ALEX: It's beautiful here .
BLAKE:  Yes . I feel refreshed .
ALEX:  How long will we dock ?
BLAKE:  In half an hour . The surface of the lake is calm .
ALEX:  Yes . We come at the right time .
ALEX: that was a really good meal , Gordon .
BLAKE:  It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite .
ALEX:  well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home .
BLAKE:  you're right . I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow .
ALEX:  let's see how much the bill is .
BLAKE:  don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat .
ALEX:  what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill .
BLAKE:  no , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't .
ALEX:  no way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill .
BLAKE:  alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill .
ALEX:  that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk .
BLAKE:  just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ?
ALEX:  you've got a deal .
BLAKE:  great . Bye .
ALEX:  bye .
ALEX: I hear you are planning to travel abroad .
BLAKE:  Yes . I'm going to the Untied States for travel . What places do you recommend ?
ALEX:  In my opinion , there are several places you mustn't miss , like Washington D . C , Las Vegas , New York and Los Angeles .
BLAKE:  Someone suggests that I should go to Seattle and Hawaii .
ALEX:  Yes , you may consider those two places also . Seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called Museum of Flight .
BLAKE:  And Seattle is the home of Microsoft and Boeing . That must be a great place . I can't miss it .
ALEX: This looks like a very nice house .
BLAKE:  You know , I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it .
ALEX:  The style of the exterior is just what I ’ Ve been looking for !
BLAKE:  The exterior is only half of the story . The interior is incredible .
ALEX:  This home is gorgeous on the inside !
BLAKE:  Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new .
ALEX:  The wall colors totally suit the style of this house .
BLAKE:  Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen .
ALEX:  I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops .
BLAKE:  The master suite is the best . Let ’ s go look at that next .
ALEX:  There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room .
BLAKE:  I know that you like this house , but let ’ s take a look at the others before you make up your mind .
ALEX: Room service.What can I do for you ?
BLAKE:  l am afraid there isn't any fancy soap in my room .
ALEX:  Sorry sir , we will bring you one.Anything else ?
BLAKE:  Yes.Bring me a bath towel as well .
ALEX: Good afternoon.British Airline.Is there any thing I can do for you ?
BLAKE:  Can I make a reservation for flight FW58 to San Marino ?
ALEX:  Sure . When do you want to take the plane ?
BLAKE:  Next Monday .
ALEX:  Will that be first class or economy seat ?
BLAKE:  What's the fare for a first class seat ?
ALEX:  $ 200 .
BLAKE:  Oh . I am not a wall streeter.Give me an economy one please .
ALEX: Hello , Sir . So , you are back ?
BLAKE:  Yes , hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit .
ALEX:  That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate .
BLAKE:  And I can purchase that here ?
ALEX:  Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us , the Insurance Premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle .
ALEX: Are there any beds vacant ?
BLAKE:  Yes , what kind of room do you want ?
ALEX:  I prefer one facing the sea . Besides , it should have a shower .
BLAKE:  Sorry , right now we can only have you a room without shower .
ALEX:  Well , that's fine .
ALEX: Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company .
BLAKE:  That's easy . It was your office ergonomics that decided me .
ALEX:  You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ?
BLAKE:  Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t
ALEX:  Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff .
ALEX:  Well , welcome to the team .
ALEX: Good afternoon . I've brought the extra blanket you asked for .
BLAKE:  Oh , thank you .
ALEX:  Is there anything I can do for you now ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I'm rather tired and want to go to bed early . Please make the bed .
ALEX:  Certainly , sir .
ALEX: Lin's office supplies . How may I direct your call ?
BLAKE:  Marry Lin please .
ALEX:  Sure , just a moment . ... I'm sorry no one answer the phone .
BLAKE:  All right , could I leave a message ?
ALEX:  Certainly !
BLAKE:  Please ask her to call John .
ALEX: Excuse me . Where is the way out ?
BLAKE:  Well , that's what I'm looking for myself .
ALEX:  It's very confusing in here , isn't it ?
BLAKE:  Absolutely . Oh , do you see a sign there ?
ALEX:  It should be the way out .
BLAKE:  OK . Let's go and see .
ALEX: Excuse me , I ordered the well-done steak , but this one is so tough .
BLAKE:  Well , sir , I think I have made a mistake . I will take it back to the kitchen right now .
ALEX:  I think you should be more careful next time .
BLAKE:  Yes , sir . I'm really so sorry about that .
ALEX: Allan , I am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project .
BLAKE:  Look , Sally . I ’ Ve put just as much work into this as anybody else .
ALEX:  No , I ’ m sorry . I disagree . I don ’ t think you ’ Ve been working at full speed at all .
BLAKE:  Well . I ’ m sorry you feel that way .
ALEX: Hi Joe , how are you doing today ?
BLAKE:  Things are going good today . How have you been doing , Mary ?
ALEX:  Things are going well for me , Joe .
BLAKE:  Want to go see a movie tonight ?
ALEX:  My parents are taking me to dinner tonight .
BLAKE:  Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ?
ALEX:  What movie did you want to see ?
BLAKE:  There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer .
ALEX:  I was thinking that I would like to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ”
BLAKE:  Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to !
ALEX: How's the bride-to-be ?
BLAKE:  Tired and stressed . This wedding is giving me a headache .
ALEX:  Just relax . With me as your maid of honor , everything will be fine !
BLAKE:  I'm worried that everything will be chaotic !
ALEX:  Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests .
BLAKE:  You're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ...
ALEX:  I will . Don't worry !
ALEX: Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ?
BLAKE:  Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk .
ALEX:  Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk .
BLAKE:  I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator .
ALEX:  Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ?
BLAKE:  Nothing .
ALEX:  What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see .
BLAKE:  Promise that you won't get angry .
ALEX:  OK , I promise . What is it ?
BLAKE:  It's a kitty .
ALEX:  Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house .
BLAKE:  Please , Mummy . Everybody else in my class keeps a pet . Please , I'll take care of it . It's a good kitty . It'll not bring you any trouble .
ALEX:  No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here .
BLAKE:  Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame .
ALEX:  All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up .
BLAKE:  I will . Thank you , Mummy .
ALEX: I was wondering if you could help me with something .
BLAKE:  Sure , anything you say .
ALEX:  Actually , it ’ s a little bit silly .
BLAKE:  Don ’ t worry about it , just ask .
ALEX:  What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes ?
BLAKE:  You need to know the type of shoes you want .
ALEX:  Don ’ t worry about that . I can point it out in the store .
BLAKE:  The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . In girls shoes , the heel can be high or low .
ALEX:  Let me write all that down . I ’ m going shopping this afternoon .
ALEX: Excuse me . How long has it been since the business was founded ?
BLAKE:  It has been 12 years since it was founded in 1998 .
ALEX:  So , it has a history for more than a decade ?
BLAKE:  Yes . And it was incorporated with other businesses in 2008 due to the global financial crisis .
ALEX: What can I do for you , Madam ?
BLAKE:  Can you help me with Comprehensive Credit Granting ?
ALEX:  Certainly , Madam . What would you like to know ?
BLAKE:  Well , everything really .
ALEX:  All right . We can grant a Financing Promise Quota , if you qualify . This means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way . Firstly , your Credit Rating must be class A , and your Debt to Asset Ratio must be top notch , for the industry you are involved in .
ALEX: Let's do something outdoors today .
BLAKE:  All right . But I don't want to play tennis . We played tennis last weekend .
ALEX:  Okay . what do you want to do ?
BLAKE:  I want to go jogging .
ALEX:  All right . That sounds like fun .
ALEX: Good afternoon . I come here specially to pick up my tickets . I booked it last month.This is my reservation note .
BLAKE:  I am terribly sorry . You didn't come to reconfirm recently.You should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled .
ALEX:  But I have been so busy all these days.Well , is there any other ticket available ? I want the next one .
ALEX: The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest .
BLAKE:  Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West .
ALEX:  No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested .
BLAKE:  You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ?
ALEX:  Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other .
BLAKE:  Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ?
ALEX:  Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely .
BLAKE:  Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ?
ALEX:  Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate .
ALEX: Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ?
BLAKE:  We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock .
ALEX:  You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order .
BLAKE:  OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ?
ALEX:  I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time .
BLAKE:  OK , will do .
ALEX: I want a pair of sports shoes , Adidas .
BLAKE:  What size do you want ?
ALEX:  I wear size 40 .
BLAKE:  How about this one ? It's the latest design .
ALEX:  Oh , I like the color .
ALEX: May I help you ?
BLAKE:  I'm looking for a pair of shoes .
ALEX:  What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale .
BLAKE:  I wear size 36.This pair looks nice.Can I try them on ?
ALEX:  Of course , yes.They look nice.And they're not expensive .
BLAKE:  How much are they ?
ALEX:  They are $ 168 .
BLAKE:  I'll take them .
ALEX: A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ?
BLAKE:  I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ?
ALEX:  Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals .
BLAKE:  Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills .
ALEX:  Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance .
BLAKE:  Ok , then we can sign up for it together .
ALEX: Who's it knocking at the door ?
BLAKE:  I think it's the postman.Will you go and open the door ?
ALEX:  All right . I'll get it .
ALEX: Good evening . Welcome to Cherry's . Do you have a reservation ?
BLAKE:  No , we don't .
ALEX:  How many of you , please ?
BLAKE:  Six , including two kids .
ALEX:  I'm afraid all the big tables are taken .
ALEX: Hi , I think I was supposed to call for my test results today .
BLAKE:  If you go onto our website and put in your password , you can access your test results .
ALEX:  Are you saying that there weren ’ t any problems ?
BLAKE:  I will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem .
ALEX:  Will I be able to read the results on the website and understand them ?
BLAKE:  Yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about .
ALEX:  How will I know what the numbers mean ?
BLAKE:  You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range .
ALEX:  How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ?
BLAKE:  We put all of your test results up in the same place . Just check the dates for what you need .
ALEX: This is our rock-bottom price , Mr . Lee .
BLAKE:  If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off .
ALEX:  What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great .
BLAKE:  I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ?
ALEX:  What's your proposal ?
BLAKE:  Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway .
ALEX:  Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible !
BLAKE:  What would you suggest ?
ALEX:  The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go .
BLAKE:  That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with .
ALEX:  OK . We can meet halfway again .
ALEX: Hello .
BLAKE:  Good morning , Ruth . Did I wake you up ?
ALEX:  No , I was just about to get up . What's up , Carl ?
BLAKE:  Listen , I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus ?
ALEX:  B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown .
BLAKE:  Oh , you mean Canal Street ?
ALEX:  That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown .
BLAKE:  Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ?
ALEX:  At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ?
BLAKE:  I cannot get hold of her yet .
ALEX:  See you around , Carl .
BLAKE:  See you later .
ALEX: Has your company been affected much by government legislation ?
BLAKE:  Yes , we have . We've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards .
ALEX:  What about your use of raw materials ?
BLAKE:  Well , we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we ’ re not allowed to use lead in our products any more .
ALEX:  What happens if you exceed the limits ?
BLAKE:  We try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine .
ALEX: Have you got any better ?
BLAKE:  That's the best there is .
ALEX:  Okay , I'll take one .
BLAKE:  That'll be $ 200 , sir .
ALEX: Good morning , sir . Sorry to disturb you . May I make up the room now ?
BLAKE:  Yes , please . We're on our way out , so we put the ' make up ' sign on . Could you bring us some towels and hangers ?
ALEX:  No problem , sir . Everything will be ready when you come back .
ALEX: What are the factors that have great impact on the perspective of this corporation ?
BLAKE:  External factors . I think the main external factors are political , economic , social and technological factors .
ALEX:  What are the internal factors that influence the company ?
BLAKE:  The internal factors are composed of human resources , team spirit , innovation spirit and coordination between different departments , etc .
ALEX: I don ’ t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . He says painful words everyday .
BLAKE:  What words ? Can you tell me ?
ALEX:  He says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ’ t want mommy , very quickly if I do something that he doesn ’ t like . You know , if I wash his face or change his clothes , things like that .
BLAKE:  Honey , I don ’ t know what to tell you . Of course Tony is a young child . But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason .
ALEX:  Yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable .
BLAKE:  I suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . If he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness .
ALEX:  It ’ s easy to say , but I will try .
BLAKE:  Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire .
ALEX:  I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . But this doesn ’ t work , instead he picks up another bad habit .
ALEX: How can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates . I would like to see Mr . Smith .
ALEX:  Do you have an appointment ?
BLAKE:  Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock .
ALEX:  I wonder if Mr . Smith forgot your meeting . I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . Will you please have a seat ?
BLAKE:  Sure .
ALEX:  Yes , Mr . Mason , I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry , she said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She could be with your shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ?
BLAKE:  That would be very nice . Thank you .
ALEX:  Right this way , Mr . Mason . We can start with our front office . When Ms . Terry is ready , you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor . There is a conference room already prepared
ALEX: did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ?
BLAKE:  no , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend .
ALEX:  yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go .
BLAKE:  they must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood .
ALEX:  they're also one of the richest couples . They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want .
BLAKE:  I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars .
ALEX:  did either one of them win an Oscar this year ?
BLAKE:  I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything .
ALEX:  Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?
BLAKE:  yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous .
ALEX:  I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .
BLAKE:  people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated .
ALEX:  I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .
BLAKE:  that's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go .
ALEX:  thank goodness we're not rich and famous !
BLAKE:  being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich .
ALEX: Next , please .
BLAKE:  Could I purchase Euro with RIB here ? I have to stay here for months .
ALEX:  Yes , the rate for cash purchases is listed on the electronica screen , so you have seen the rate of exchange .
BLAKE:  Yes , I have known of it .
ALEX:  How much do you like to exchange ?
BLAKE:  20,000 RIB .
ALEX:  In what denominations ?
BLAKE:  It doesn't matter , but leave me some small changes , that will be convenient in daily life .
ALEX:  Right , I will exchange for you now . Please sign the exchange form giving the name and telephone .
BLAKE:  Well , could you change them too ? The dollars , I want to change them into Swiss francs .
ALEX:  OK , wait for a moment . Well , I am sorry , but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins . In this case , you'd better change 2,000 $ to Swiss francs .
BLAKE:  It doesn't matter .
ALEX:  Please sign the memo on the bottom and keep your money and memo .
BLAKE:  Thanks a lot . Good-bye .
ALEX: Why are you holding me in this jail cell ?
BLAKE:  We'd like to hear your account of the events of last night .
ALEX: I have to go up to London for a couple of days next week . Would you like to come ?
BLAKE:  That would be nice . How are you getting there ?
ALEX:  Well , I prefer to go on the train , but I suppose you want me to take the car .
BLAKE:  Oh , I much prefer to go by car , then we don't need to get to the station with our luggage and ...
ALEX:  And I've got to drive . You know I'm not fond of that . I found it much more relaxing to sit in the train .
BLAKE:  Which is more expensive ?
ALEX:  But very much quicker . But I know we'll never agree on this subject . You prefer the car . I prefer the train .
BLAKE:  Now , have you ever thought of going by express bus ?
ALEX: I want to take a look at that home with the Open House flags out front .
BLAKE:  What a wonderful neighborhood ! Can you find that house on our Open House list ?
ALEX:  Yes , that is one of the houses that we have on our list .
BLAKE:  They always make the front yards look so great for Open Houses . Let ’ s see what the inside looks like .
ALEX:  I am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent know that we were here .
BLAKE:  Signing the registry is a good idea . I think I want to see the kitchen next .
ALEX:  I really appreciate that the listing agent provided water on such a hot day .
BLAKE:  I need to pick up a flyer with the information about the house on it .
ALEX:  Is the current asking price listed on the flyer ?
BLAKE:  The asking price has recently gone down to two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars .
ALEX: Hello . This is Mrs . Wilson . I'd like to buy a new car . Could you offer me a new type of the car , please ?
BLAKE:  Oh , Madam , buy what ?
ALEX:  A new car . And I've got a small family , two children , and I haven't got a lot of money and ...
BLAKE:  Oh , oh , Madam , Madam , I'm afraid you have the wrong number .
ALEX:  Isn't this the car store ?
BLAKE:  No . It's Mike's Sporting Goods .
ALEX:  Oh , sorry . Do you know the number for a car store , then ?
BLAKE:  No . I don't . I suggest you look in the phone book .
ALEX:  I'm sorry to have bothered you .
BLAKE:  No problem .
ALEX: How about going to the cinema tonight ?
BLAKE:  That's great . What's on tonight ?
ALEX:  I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one .
BLAKE:  Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better .
ALEX:  Don't you think it's too bloody ?
BLAKE:  On the contrary , very exciting .
ALEX: Hello , I scheduled an appointment with Dr . Smith , and I can ’ t make it on that day .
BLAKE:  What day was your appointment on ?
ALEX:  My appointment was on Monday .
BLAKE:  What time had you chosen ?
ALEX:  It was for 10
BLAKE:  I am looking at your appointment right now . What day would you prefer ?
ALEX:  I would prefer next Thursday .
BLAKE:  What time would be best for you ?
ALEX:  I want to come in at 2
BLAKE:  I am writing you down for that time . We look forward to seeing you .
ALEX: Office Supplies , Inc . Robert speaking , may I help you ?
BLAKE:  Hi , Robert . This is Janet Reese calling from American Advertising . We placed an order with you about a week ago .
ALEX:  Yes , Ms . Reese . I remember , you spoke with me . Is there a problem ?
BLAKE:  Well , it still hasn ’ t gotten here , and my boss is pretty angry about it .
ALEX: Ms Anderson , my name is Mike . I am Division Chief of ABC Company . Welcome to Toronto .
BLAKE:  Thank you . It's a pleasure to meet you .
ALEX:  A pleasure meeting you as well , the flowers are for you .
BLAKE:  Thank you , they are beautiful .
ALEX: I am really interested in buying this television .
BLAKE:  That's so great !
ALEX:  How much are you selling it for ?
BLAKE:  This t . v is only $ 2500 .
ALEX:  You can't be serious .
BLAKE:  That's how much this t . v costs .
ALEX:  That's too expensive for me .
BLAKE:  This television is of very high quality .
ALEX:  You can't go down on the price .
BLAKE:  By how much ?
ALEX:  I'll buy it for $ 2000 .
BLAKE:  I'm sorry , but the price is final .
ALEX: Did you pack this bag yourself ? Has it been out of your possession at any time before checking-in ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I packed it myself , and it hasn ’ t been out of my possession .
ALEX:  Are you bringing in any plants or animal products ?
BLAKE:  No .
ALEX:  Our sniffer dog seems to disagree . Do you mind if we look in your suitcase ?
BLAKE:  Not at all . Go right ahead .
ALEX:  What ’ s this sir ?
BLAKE:  It ’ s traditional Chinese Medicine . I mix it with hot water like tea . Sorry . I forgot about it .
ALEX:  What are these red things sir ?
BLAKE:  Oh no ! I forgot about those too ! Those are Chinese sausages for my Aunt Lily .
ALEX:  I ’ m sorry sir , but you can ’ t take any of this into the country . We will also have to check your carry-on . Please step this way . Don ’ t ’ be nervous ; we ’ ll just look through it briefly and then
ALEX: Hello.Is Bob there , please ?
BLAKE:  Hold on a second please . I'm sorry . He has gone out .
ALEX:  Oh.This is Paul.When will he be back ?
BLAKE:  He will be back at about seven o'clock .
ALEX:  Can I leave a message please ?
BLAKE:  Yes , certainly .
ALEX:  Please tell him I'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon .
BLAKE:  All right . I'll tell him when he comes back .
ALEX:  Thank you very much .
ALEX: Hey , son , are you insured ?
BLAKE:  Not yet , but I'm thinking of it . Have you bought one , Dad ?
ALEX:  I took out a life insurance policy and made your mother the beneficiary .
BLAKE:  Can you tell me why you want to buy it ?
ALEX:  I am a fireman and it is a dangerous job . I have to consider your mother's life .
BLAKE:  Oh , I see . Do you advise me to buy one ?
ALEX:  You have children now . What if something , God forbid , happens to you ?
BLAKE:  That's true . Well , how much do you think I should get ?
ALEX:  A $ 100 000 policy shouldn't be too expensive . Here , call my agent . He'll give you a good deal .
ALEX: Excuse me , Mr . Emory ? Mr . Macmillan , would like to know if you have the completed schedule for next week ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I do , Susan . Just a moment . Here it is .
ALEX:  Thank you , sir . Sorry to trouble you .
BLAKE:  Not at all , Susan . Just tell him to leave it with my secretary when he ’ s finished with it
ALEX: Where are you going , Jane ?
BLAKE:  I'm going to the hospital to see Susan .
ALEX:  I saw her yesterday.She was a little better .
BLAKE:  Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there ?
ALEX:  No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital .
BLAKE:  Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ?
ALEX:  Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus .
BLAKE:  Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 .
ALEX:  But number 13 buses leave from the center of town.You ' ll have to walk two miles to catch one .
ALEX: Good morning , Passport , please .
BLAKE:  Here you are .
ALEX:  Ah , thank you.Please bring your luggage here for inspection .
BLAKE:  Ok.But is there anything wrong ?
ALEX:  It's just a regular inspection . Do you have anything to declare ?
BLAKE:  I've got 6 packets of cigarettes and 2 bottles of champagne.Besides , I have two cameras , one is for my own use , and the other is a gift .
ALEX:  Well , the cigarettes and the champagne are not in excess of the duty-free allowance . But according to our law , each passenger is allowed only one camera duty-free.You ' ll have to pay duty for the other one .
BLAKE:  Ok . Where shall I pay duty for it ?
ALEX:  Please wait a minute . I'll make out the duty memo ... Here you are.Take this and pay to the woman over there .
BLAKE:  I've paid for it . Here's the receipt .
ALEX:  Very well . I hope you ' ll enjoy your stay in America .
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX: Hello , Nancy , nice to see you .
BLAKE:  Nice to see you , too . I heard you are a staff of Nokia company .
ALEX:  Yes , I ’ m satisfied with this job .
BLAKE:  Congratulations . What did you do during the interview ?
ALEX:  Pay more attention to the external expressions , because they are important for the first impression . Good manner and style of conversation can let other feel your good self-cultivation . Good gestures and mien can let other feel very comfortable .
BLAKE:  How can I have the good external expressions ?
ALEX:  Don ’ t worry about that . You just pay more attention to the details of people ’ s action in life , and you will know how to transfer information by their body language .
ALEX: Stupid girl , making me spend so much money , now I have to get it from the ATM ...
BLAKE:  Hello , welcome to Universal Bank . Please insert your card into the slot .
ALEX:  I know where to put my card ! Stupid machine , talking to me like I ’ m an idiot ...
BLAKE:  Please input your 6 digit PIN code followed by the pound key . Thank you . Please select an option.Thank you . You have selected withdrawal .
ALEX:  Yeah , yeah , I know what I selected . Just gimme my money !
BLAKE:  Please type the amount you would like to withdraw . Thank you , you want to transfer 10000 USD to the World Wildlife Foundation . If this is correct please press 1 .
ALEX:  No , no ! Stupid machine , what are you doing ! No !
BLAKE:  Confirmed . Thank you for using our bank ! Please remove your card from the slot . Goodbye !
ALEX:  No , no way ! What happened ? Give me my money !
BLAKE:  Danger , danger ! The exits have been sealed and the doors will remain locked in until the local authorities arrive . Thank you for using our bank . Have a nice day .
ALEX: Joe , how are you doing ?
BLAKE:  I am great ! How about you , Mary ? How are you ?
ALEX:  I am doing great ! Thank you for asking , Joe .
BLAKE:  I was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight ?
ALEX:  I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper .
BLAKE:  OK . What about going to the movies on Friday night ?
ALEX:  What were you planning on seeing ?
BLAKE:  I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer .
ALEX:  How about “ The Secret Life of Bees ” ?
BLAKE:  That's a chick flick !
ALEX: What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ?
BLAKE:  First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations .
ALEX:  That ’ s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ’ ll need someone to hire staff .
BLAKE:  I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don ’ t think we should use an agency , because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of
ALEX:  Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD .
BLAKE:  Why didn ’ t we choose an office in the CBD ?
ALEX:  The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ?
BLAKE:  Yes . We ’ Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month .
ALEX:  When will the branch office open ?
BLAKE:  Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly .
ALEX:  Has and advertising campaign been prepared ?
BLAKE:  Yes , it has . We ’ re going to target the business community through business magazines .
ALEX:  I made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy . We should be able to get plenty of customers .
ALEX: Good afternoon . what can I do for you ?
BLAKE:  I want to pick up my valuables .
ALEX:  May I have your key please ?
BLAKE:  Sure . Here you are .
ALEX:  Here is your valuable . Is that right ?
BLAKE:  Yes , thank you .
ALEX: did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ?
BLAKE:  why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that .
ALEX:  well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers .
BLAKE:  do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ?
ALEX:  no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions .
BLAKE:  it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America .
ALEX:  religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal .
BLAKE:  what do you think about abortion ?
ALEX:  I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself .
BLAKE:  do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?
ALEX:  I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children .
BLAKE:  why not ? It's their children , too .
ALEX:  that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand .
BLAKE:  that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter .
ALEX: Come to think of it , you should get out your English books and catch up on your reading assignments .
BLAKE:  But I don't have any reading assignments .
ALEX:  Then review for your test . You'll do even better . And maybe reading will help you get to sleep .
BLAKE:  Aw , Mom-you're such a drag .
ALEX:  You say that now , Lily , but you'll thank me later . I'm your mom , and mother knows best .
ALEX: I'm just calling to see if you have made any decision about the position .
BLAKE:  Sorry , we haven't made the decision at all .
ALEX:  Do you have any idea when you might arrive at a decision ?
BLAKE:  We will let you know probably next Monday . I hope to give you a positive reply .
ALEX:  I'm willing to wait until you have come to a decision .
ALEX: How did you find your apartment ?
BLAKE:  You can check on the bulletin boards at school for local housing .
ALEX:  What if I need a roommate ?
BLAKE:  There are websites that can hook you up with a roommate .
ALEX:  How much do apartments cost around here ?
BLAKE:  It depends on what you want . Do you want a one - or two-bedroom apartment ?
ALEX:  I just need a one-bedroom apartment .
BLAKE:  That will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month .
ALEX:  Would you come with me to look at apartments ?
BLAKE:  I would be happy to look at apartments with you .
ALEX: Have you heard what happened ?
BLAKE:  Heard what ?
ALEX:  Deborah already had her baby .
BLAKE:  I didn't know that .
ALEX:  I thought you knew .
BLAKE:  I honestly didn't know .
ALEX:  The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .
BLAKE:  That's good to hear .
ALEX:  Will you go and visit them ?
BLAKE:  Of course I will .
ALEX:  I just wanted to give you the good news .
BLAKE:  Thanks for letting me know .
ALEX: How silly of you to jump out of the window !
BLAKE:  But that was the first thing that came into my mind when I heard the shout earthquake !
ALEX:  Why not use staircases ? The terror was not so violent at that time .
BLAKE:  That would be too late .
ALEX:  Maybe the situation is too urgent .
BLAKE:  Yes , I think I should have jumped in any case .
ALEX: I need to stop eating such unhealthy foods .
BLAKE:  I know what you mean . I've started eating better myself .
ALEX:  What foods do you eat now ?
BLAKE:  I tend to stick to fruits , vegetables , and chicken .
ALEX:  Those are the only things you eat ?
BLAKE:  That's basically what I eat .
ALEX:  Why aren't you eating anything else ?
BLAKE:  Well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy .
ALEX:  And the chicken ?
BLAKE:  It's really healthy to eat when you bake it .
ALEX:  I guess that does sound a lot healthier .
ALEX: Good morning ! I am a new comer in our office .
BLAKE:  Good morning ! Welcome to our office !
ALEX:  Nice to meet you ! My name is Grace Williams .
BLAKE:  Nice to meet you too ! I am Peter Smith .
ALEX:  Today is my first day at work !
BLAKE:  Well , hope you will enjoy your first day ! Just ask me if you need any help .
ALEX:  Thank you . It's very kind of you .
BLAKE:  You are welcome .
ALEX: Do you have experience in advertising ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I used to have a part-time job in advertising company .
ALEX:  What were you mean duties there ?
BLAKE:  I mostly did advertising planning .
ALEX:  What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ?
BLAKE:  I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market .
ALEX:  What was the most important thing you have learned at work ?
BLAKE:  The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success . If I want to make in marking in advertising industry , I can ’ t stop studying and creating .
ALEX: The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !
BLAKE:  Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
ALEX:  That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying !
BLAKE:  Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded .
ALEX:  I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
ALEX: Do you have anything to do after this ?
BLAKE:  No , I don't .
ALEX:  Shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks ?
BLAKE:  That sounds like a good idea .

BLAKE:  You have much patience .
ALEX:  Wow ! Your calligraphy is very beautiful . It was worth the wait !
BLAKE:  Thank you . Today I'm writing a kind of poem called a Chinese couplet .
ALEX:  What does it say ?
BLAKE:  This is an especially famous one . It says " May the passing days bring you health and longevity . May this season of renewal find you basked in riches . "
ALEX:  That's very nice . Is it for sale ?

ALEX:  Really ? Then what do you do with it ?
BLAKE:  I give it away . Here , this one is for you .
ALEX:  Wow ! Really ? Are you sure ? Now I'll have a lucky year !
BLAKE:  Remember , real luck must be created ( by ) yourself , and then it cannot be given or taken away ...
ALEX: I often recalled the days when Tom and I were madly in love .
BLAKE:  Very romantic ?
ALEX:  Yeah . He always tickled my finny bone with his college stories .
BLAKE:  You married him for that reason ?
ALEX:  Definitely not . The most important thing was we loved each other .
ALEX: It seldom rains this summer .
BLAKE:  Yeah , some places are very short of water .
ALEX:  Because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse .
BLAKE:  You see , This time I traveled to the West . When I looked out of the windows of the rain , all the lands that I could see are as dry as a bone .
ALEX:  It is serious .
ALEX: I'm looking forward to summer vacation .
BLAKE:  Me too .
ALEX: My granny is such a kind-hearted person . She is willing to help .
BLAKE:  She does have a heart of gold .
ALEX:  You can say that again .
ALEX: Look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium . It says that she is really gifted and so popular now , that she is booked solid with appointments for the next twelve months !
BLAKE:  You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo , do you ?
ALEX:  Well , I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true !
BLAKE:  Of course it does ! They tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house . I think most of the times they are just scam artists .
ALEX:  Well , historically it is a practice that many cultures share . Reading the tarot cards , in the east they would even read tea leaves ! I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes .
BLAKE:  All superstitious nonsense ! I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks .
ALEX: Can I help you , sir ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I'd like a book about law .
ALEX:  Would you tell me the name of the book and the author ?

BLAKE:  Not bad.It really is great to see you again.Where have you been ?
ALEX:  Guangzhou . I've got a cousin there .
ALEX: I am so glad I caught you at home . I need your help !
BLAKE:  What's up , Robert ?
ALEX:  Cafe au lait , cafe latte , cappuccino , cafe mocha ... I can't keep them all straight !
BLAKE:  Slow down . What are you talking about ?
ALEX:  It's about a girl . No , an angel ! I'm going to the coffee shop where she works right now .
ALEX: Hello , is this the ABC company ?
BLAKE:  Yes , may I help you ?
ALEX:  We have just arrived from Tokyo only ... looking for a reserve car of your company . All of above , we cannot find it .
BLAKE:  What is your reservation number ?
ALEX:  Our reservation number is J - 221 .
BLAKE:  Let me see . Oh , yes , we have your reservation number .
ALEX:  You mean you haven ’ t arranged any car ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m sorry to say no .
ALEX:  Here I ’ ll take taxi instead , how do you refund us ?
ALEX: What kind of gas does this car take ?
BLAKE:  I don't know . It's a rental .
ALEX:  I will give you premium unleaded . Alright ?
BLAKE:  Sure , why not ?
ALEX:  That is the pump you are in front of .
BLAKE:  Is it expensive ?
ALEX:  It is the most expensive .
BLAKE:  Well , I don't want it then . Can I move to another pump ?
ALEX:  Yes , I can give you regular unleaded . But you have to back up the car a little .
BLAKE:  Give me regular unleaded then . I will back up.Can you wash my windows for me ?
ALEX:  I'm sorry , sir . This is not a full service gas station . I will help you fill the gas , but we don't wash windows here .
BLAKE:  Really ? Well , I guess I have to get used to it .
ALEX: Mary , it's good to see you !
BLAKE:  Josh and I were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we'd drop by .
ALEX:  I am so glad that you decided to stop by !
BLAKE:  Yes , it has been a long time since we have seen you .
ALEX:  Mary , can I get Josh or you something to drink ?
BLAKE:  Oh no , thank you . We aren't all that thirsty .
ALEX:  How about a little snack then ?
BLAKE:  No , thank you , we just ate lunch a little while ago .
ALEX:  Well then , how is your family ?
BLAKE:  Everyone is doing great . My sister finally had her baby .
ALEX: Everything is now . I'm kind of sick of it .
BLAKE:  Each ring has 3 small diamonds inside the band .
ALEX:  Oooh ! One for each of the zeros in 2000 ! Wow !
BLAKE:  Stop making fun of me .
ALEX:  So find a guy to marry and you can get one !
BLAKE:  I don't need a guy to buy a wedding ring !
ALEX:  Oh , I see . You're going to wear one and pretend you're married to try to attract guys .
ALEX: I went to the tutoring service centre on campus today . And I got a job .
BLAKE:  Congratulation . What will you do ?
ALEX:  They got me a part-time tutoring job , teaching an Australian businessman Chinese .
BLAKE:  That's wonderful . I want to get a part-time job too . Tell me what I should do .
ALEX:  It's very simple actually . You can go to the service centre and have your name and job interest resisted . They will give you a call if any job comes up .
BLAKE:  Good . I'll do it .
ALEX: Has Robert ever missed coming to one of our parties ?
BLAKE:  Only once or twice at the most .
ALEX:  Do you know why ?
BLAKE:  I have no idea .
ALEX: Wow ! What a beautiful scenic spot ! It's so open . And just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness .
BLAKE:  You can have a bird view of Guiling City from the top of the mountain .
ALEX:  Wonderful ! I'll often come here for mountain climbing .
BLAKE:  You should . Many Guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the morning .
ALEX:  No wonder people say
BLAKE:  Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky !
ALEX:  I didn't know you liked bird-watching .
BLAKE:  I don't really . I just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . This place is full of it .
ALEX: Hide me , Yi-jun ! The kids all think I'm the real Easter bunny !
BLAKE:  Aw , that's sweet ! I knew your costume would be a success .
ALEX:  It's a success all right . The kids keep trying to catch me .
BLAKE:  Yeah , I saw that . I thought you were playing a game with them .
ALEX:  Some game ! You try being tackled by ten kids at once !
BLAKE:  Um , Holly ? Look behind you . They're coming this way .
ALEX: hi , Bob , I am so glad that you came .
BLAKE:  of course I'd come . I couldn't think of a better chance to see all my old friends .
ALEX:  yeah . It's hard to believe that it's been ten years since graduation . It feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas .
BLAKE:  how time flies . But hey , how are things going with you ?
ALEX:  oh , where to start ? There have been ups and downs . I'm still trying to find my place in this world . It's only recently that I've been able to start settling down . How about you ? You still with Jenn
BLAKE:  yeah , Jenny and I got married right after graduation . It was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . I was supporting us both while she continued her studies . But now things are getting better
ALEX:  oh , that sounds wonderful . I have always known you two would make it . I hope I can keep in better contact with you guys . I don't want us to drift apart again .
BLAKE:  definitely ! Actually , we just moved into a new place . There's a house-warming party this Saturday , if you are free ? I know Jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party .
ALEX:  sounds great ! I'll be there .
ALEX: I guess I'm just a little nervous . I'm giving everything I have to invoking , and ...
BLAKE:  and what if it doesn't work out , right ?
ALEX:  Exactly .
BLAKE:  You need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . You know how I know ?
ALEX:  How ?
BLAKE:  Because I won't let it fail .
ALEX:  But what about tomorrow ? What if Stars.com decides to go with WebTracker , and not us ?
ALEX: Are you ready for the camping trip ?
BLAKE:  All set . I've got my makeup , my Cds , and my portable TV set ...
ALEX:  Hello ! We're supposed to be getting back to nature .
BLAKE:  Yeah , yeah . Anyway ... I'm packed . Are you ?
ALEX:  I've been packed for a week . All my stuff is in this backpack .
BLAKE:  Let me see ... two books ... birdseed ?
ALEX:  That's trail mix !
BLAKE:  Same difference . What's this ?
ALEX: It's getting late . I really have to go .
BLAKE:  I hope we'll get together again soon .
ALEX:  I hope so . A good journey to you !
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX: I ’ m fed up with marriage .
BLAKE:  Why do you say so ? Everyone admires that you have a good wife .
ALEX:  Oh , no . When we were poor , we often tried our best to make ends meet . It was a hard time .
BLAKE:  But now you are rich .
ALEX:  And we have some squabbles on some boring things .
BLAKE:  This is ordinary marriage life .
ALEX: How about you and Tom ? What time is your wedding ?
BLAKE:  Don ’ t be kidding , OK ?
ALEX:  What ’ s the matter ? So angry . I ’ m just playing a joke with you .
BLAKE:  Because I have given him up as a bad job . Our relation has been over .
ALEX: Margaret , do you think I should enroll in the science course ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I think so , If you want to graduated this year , you've got to take a science course .
ALEX:  Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses .
BLAKE:  Well , I have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics.what you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors .
ALEX:  Yes , I really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school .
BLAKE:  That's a problem .
ALEX: What are you listening to ? Is that Beethoven or Mozart ?
BLAKE:  It's Beethoven . Do you like it ?
ALEX:  I think Beethoven's music is incredible . I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . Do you believe that ?
BLAKE:  I don't know about that , but I do think that it helps people relax .
ALEX:  What other kind of music do you listen to ?
BLAKE:  Actually , I mostly just listen classical music . What about you ?
ALEX:  To be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me .
BLAKE:  What kind of music do you prefer then ?
ALEX:  I like pop music . Do you ?
BLAKE:  Not really . I don't think pop music has much depth .
ALEX:  I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much .
BLAKE:  How long have you been in to pop music , then ?
ALEX:  I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ?
BLAKE:  Not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all .
ALEX:  So , how did you become interested in it ?
BLAKE:  Well , when I was about 10 years old , I started playing the piano . I think that's how it all started .
ALEX:  Do you still play piano ?
BLAKE:  Yes , it's one of my hobbies .
ALEX: Hi Paul . How are you , friend .
BLAKE:  Not good . My cousin is driving me up the wall .
ALEX:  How so ?
BLAKE:  He stays up untill all hours of the night , and he never lifts a finger to help .
ALEX:  Have you talk to him about it ?
BLAKE:  Not yet , but I have to soon . He's eating me out of house and home . I caught him reading the fridge again last night
ALEX:  Ahahah , Maybe that will help you lose weight .
BLAKE:  This is no laughing matter , Nick .
ALEX:  Sorry Paul . I couldn't help it . So why doesn't he give you a hand ?
BLAKE:  He watch the tob too much . Now really I don't know . But I can't handle this much longer .
ALEX:  Well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , OK ?
ALEX: You're from New York , aren't you ?
BLAKE:  Yes , that's right .
ALEX:  What do you suggest I should see in New York ?
BLAKE:  Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ?
ALEX:  No , I don't like museums . They're boring .
BLAKE:  Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ?
ALEX:  Ah ! That sounds interesting .
ALEX: What's your favorite book ?
BLAKE:  It's Gone With the Wind .
ALEX:  Why do you like it best ?
BLAKE:  I enjoy the various characters and the plot .
ALEX:  Well . I like the Thom Birds best .
BLAKE:  Is it very interesting ?
ALEX:  Sure . I like the writer's language , too .
BLAKE:  If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book .
ALEX:  Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
BLAKE:  That's a good idea . Let's go !
ALEX: John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ?
BLAKE:  Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ?
ALEX:  It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day .
BLAKE:  You forgot all of about it , didn't you ?
ALEX: I ’ m pretty sure that Jim will turn out to be a good lawyer .
BLAKE:  How can you be so sure ?
ALEX:  He knows a lot about law and he ’ s eloquent , too .
ALEX: Could you tell me if you have ever taken a class from Dr . Miller ?
BLAKE:  Yes . Are you going to be taking a class from him ?
ALEX:  Yes , but I have never taken his class before .
BLAKE:  He is very interesting and challenging . Is that what you are looking for ?
ALEX:  Yes , that's what I need .
BLAKE:  He is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade . Are you willing to study hard ?
ALEX:  Yes , I guess so .
BLAKE:  What I really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher . Do you enjoy that in a teacher ?
ALEX:  Yes , I had a teacher like that before .
BLAKE:  Did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience ?
ALEX:  No , I didn't , but that could be a good thing .
BLAKE:  Well , take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you . Good luck !
ALEX: Honey , what's wrong with you ?
BLAKE:  I'm not feeling well . I'm very nervous .
ALEX:  Take it easy . We are going to have our own baby . You should be happy .
BLAKE:  Yeah , I know .
ALEX:  The doctors and the nurses will help you . And I will be waiting for you right here , praying for you and our baby .
BLAKE:  Thank you , dear . I feel better now .
ALEX: The weather is terrible .
BLAKE:  Yeah . It's been raining a lot these days .
ALEX:  I have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain .
BLAKE:  Have you heard when it's supposed to get better ?
ALEX:  I saw the weather report , and it's going to rain for the next eight days .
BLAKE:  That sucks so much . What are we going to do ?
ALEX:  I'm getting pretty bored . We should do something despite the rain .
BLAKE:  I'm with you . What do you have in mind ?
ALEX:  I haven't been to the Mall in a long time . Let's go there .
BLAKE:  That sounds good . They have a movie theatre there , so if we get bored , we can watch a movie .
ALEX:  Great . I'll stop by your place now .
BLAKE:  Ok . Don't forget to bring your umbrella . The rain can start up again anytime .
ALEX: Come in , come in , what can I do for you ?
BLAKE:  Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ?
ALEX:  Yes , I am applying on it .
BLAKE:  I wonder if I could enroll in it . I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ...
ALEX:  Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up .
BLAKE:  I know , but geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field .
ALEX:  Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll .
BLAKE:  Oh , thanks , professor Donald . This is really very nice of you .
ALEX: ... so , I said , let ’ s take a break.And since that night , I ’ Ve been waiting for him to call , but I still haven ’ t heard from him . You don ’ t think he ’ s seeing someone else , do you ?
BLAKE:  Come on , don ’ t be so dramatic ! I ’ m sure everything is going to work out just fine .
ALEX:  You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ’ t he call ?
BLAKE:  But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes .
ALEX:  He ’ s the love of my life ! I ’ Ve really messed this up .
BLAKE:  Come on , hon . Pull yourself together . It ’ s going to be alright .
ALEX:  But I ... I still love him ! And it ’ s all my fault ! I can ’ t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it ’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ’ Ve totally messed this up !
BLAKE:  You know what , Veronica , I think you should make the first step . I ’ m sure he ’ ll forgive you ...
ALEX:  No , this is not gonna happen ! I ... I ’ Ve ruined everything ...
BLAKE:  do you hear something ?
ALEX: what's wrong , Jerry ? You look so upset .
BLAKE:  to be honest , I was just dumped .
ALEX:  oh , I'm sorry to hear that . You can go on a holiday to cheer you up .
BLAKE:  no , thanks . I'm not in the mood for traveling .
ALEX:  come on . A trip will do you good . Are you doing anything this weekend ?
BLAKE:  I was planning on doing a lot of wallowing .
ALEX:  well , my friends and I are planning on going to Shangri-La on Saturday . Do you want to come with us ?
BLAKE:  where is that ?
ALEX:  not very far from here . We'll fly . It's about one and a half hours .
BLAKE:  what's there to see ?
ALEX:  there is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes .
BLAKE:  oh , sounds nice .
ALEX:  yes , the scenery there is breathtaking . I have some pictures at home . You can come over and take a look if you like .
BLAKE:  ok . Then I can make up my mind .
ALEX: Did you have any kind of punishment in your life and studies ?
BLAKE:  Yes , just once .
ALEX:  What was the reason ?
BLAKE:  I once played truant when I was in college because I intended to organize a donation activity for the disaster-hit areas in Sichuan .
ALEX: Do you want to hang out tomorrow ?
BLAKE:  Oh , I can't . I have a date !
ALEX:  Really ? Wow with who ?
BLAKE:  This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months . She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend .
ALEX:  Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ?
BLAKE:  Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat .
ALEX:  That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ?
BLAKE:  It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy .
ALEX:  I guess it does seem logical . I'll have to check it out !
ALEX: Well , I'm afraid I must be going now . I have no idea it was so late .
BLAKE:  Stay for dinner with us .
ALEX:  I'm afraid I can't . I have a dinner party at seven tonight . You see , I am going to England the day after tomorrow .
BLAKE:  Well , I won't keep you then . It was very nice of you to come to see me .
ALEX:  It has been a pleasure . Goodbye .
BLAKE:  Goodbye . Thank you again for coming .
ALEX: Honey , do you have a second ?
BLAKE:  Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worried.What ’ s on your mind ?
ALEX:  We need to talk .
BLAKE:  Okay ...
ALEX:  I ’ Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people .
BLAKE:  What ? Why ? I mean , we ’ Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ’ re happy together , aren ’ t we ?
ALEX:  That ’ s just it , I ’ m not happy anymore , Tim . It ’ s not you , it ’ s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
BLAKE:  So , what are you saying ? You ’ re breaking up with me because I ’ m perfect ?
ALEX:  Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ’ d only hurt you , I know I ’ d only make you cry .
BLAKE:  Baby , come on . Don ’ t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ’ t leave me .
ALEX:  I can ’ t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ’ m only doing this for you . I don ’ t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do .
BLAKE:  Laura ...
ALEX:  Here are your keys . I ’ ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ’ m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ’ ll always love you . Goodbye .
ALEX: Oh , my God . I can't take it any more .
BLAKE:  What's wrong , honey ? Take it easy .
ALEX:  I am tired of doing that boring work . I just repeat doing counting everyday . It's so terrible .
BLAKE:  Me too . But I think we can do something else for a change .
ALEX:  You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ?
BLAKE:  But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company .
ALEX:  Yes , that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help .
BLAKE:  Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation .
ALEX:  I was full of ambitions before . But now I have no aim for my career .
BLAKE:  Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting .
ALEX:  That sounds interesting . But I don't know how to do that .
BLAKE:  How about a training course ?
ALEX:  A training course ? That must be costly .
BLAKE:  But it's worth it . Maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future .
ALEX:  OK , let's have a try .
BLAKE:  OK .
ALEX: Have you seen the new James Bond movie ?
BLAKE:  Oh , yes . You ?
ALEX:  Yes . What did you think of it ?
BLAKE:  I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it . What did you think of it ?
ALEX:  Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ?
BLAKE:  Mmm . That's what I thought too . I really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . And I always enjoy watching Pierce Brosnan .
ALEX:  Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ?
BLAKE:  Not as much as last time , actually . What's the name of the American actor who was in the supporting role ?
ALEX:  Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . Did you like him ?
BLAKE:  Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together , don't you think ?
ALEX:  I don't know . I think the woman was better . She provided a good love interest . Lucky James Bond !
BLAKE:  Yes !
ALEX: My friend Jean is very beautiful .
BLAKE:  What's her figure ?
ALEX:  Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too .
BLAKE:  What's the color of her eyes ?
ALEX:  Dark blue .
ALEX: Where are you going ?
BLAKE:  I'm going to buy a CD .
ALEX:  Why not listen to music online ?
BLAKE:  Then I will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line , isn't it ?
ALEX:  You can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it .
BLAKE:  I have downloaded one , but it still can't be listened .
ALEX:  In order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software .
BLAKE:  Can you recommend some to me ?
ALEX:  Certainly . Realplayer is a good .
BLAKE:  Can I download it ?
ALEX:  Yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it .
BLAKE:  I'll try it tonight .
ALEX: What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense .
BLAKE:  Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate .
ALEX:  Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ?
BLAKE:  He asked me how long it took me to learn English .
ALEX:  But , you were born and raised in California !
BLAKE:  Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes .
ALEX:  What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ?
BLAKE:  You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice .
ALEX:  So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ?
BLAKE:  I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it .
ALEX:  Are you sure he really got the message ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English .
ALEX:  That's hilarious ! What did he say ?
BLAKE:  He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good .
ALEX:  I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again .
ALEX: Could you tell me the origin of the Dragon-Boat Festival ?
BLAKE:  Yes , it's a way to commemorate a great ancient romantic poet , and the race is a symbol of the attempt to save him .
ALEX:  I see.Did they succeed in the end ?
BLAKE:  Of course not.He drowned .
ALEX: What can I do for you today ?
BLAKE:  I would like to use a computer .
ALEX:  Do you have your library card ?
BLAKE:  I sure do .
ALEX:  There is a wait for the computers .
BLAKE:  That ’ s all right .
ALEX:  You need to print your name on this list .
BLAKE:  Okay . Now what ?
ALEX:  Once a computer is available , I will let you know .
BLAKE:  How am I supposed to log on to the computer ?
ALEX:  All you do is type in the number on the back of your card .
BLAKE:  That ’ s it ? Thank you very much .
ALEX: how are you doing , Christopher ?
BLAKE:  to be honest , I'm really fed up with work at the moment . I need a break !
ALEX:  are you doing anything this weekend ?
BLAKE:  I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job !
ALEX:  are you available on Sunday ?
BLAKE:  yes , that's my only day off until Thursday .
ALEX:  ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ?
BLAKE:  that'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ?
ALEX:  it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city .
BLAKE:  what should I bring with me ?
ALEX:  we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger .
BLAKE:  I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun .
ALEX:  do you like surfing ?
BLAKE:  I've actually never tired . Do you have a surfboard ?
ALEX:  we've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun !
BLAKE:  I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ?
ALEX:  you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money .
BLAKE:  ok , where and when should I meet you ?
ALEX:  we'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square !
ALEX: I'm not really accustomed to the style of the new boss .
BLAKE:  It'll take us all some time to get used to the change .
ALEX: I give up ! I simply can't learn French !
BLAKE:  Why do you say that ? I think you're making a lot of progress .
ALEX:  No , I'm not . I try and try and I still can't speak it very well .
BLAKE:  Learning any language takes a lot of effort.But don't give up . Why don't we practise those dialogues together ?
ALEX:  Good idea . That might help .
ALEX: He said I have a big nose . I wonder what that means .
BLAKE:  You are interested in other people ’ s business , aren ’ t you ?
ALEX:  Does he mean I am inquisitive or I ’ m noisy ?
BLAKE:  Yes .
ALEX: Excuse me , I'd like to ask you a few questions about the city .
BLAKE:  OK , please .
ALEX:  My wife wants to take the children to go shopping , where is the best place to go ?
BLAKE:  I would recommend the mall , it's about 20 minutes , drive to the south in a taxi . It has a wide range of shops and restaurants .
ALEX:  Thank you . Also , we'd like to do some sightseeing while we're in town . Can you recommend some local attractions ?
BLAKE:  How old are your children ?
ALEX:  I have a 10 - year-old boy and a 6 - year-old girl .
BLAKE:  I would recommend a day at the zoo . It's fun for all the family . There is also a water park just outside the city if you would like a day trip .
ALEX:  It sounds marvelous . Thank you for your help .
ALEX: Boy , it looks like everyone in your family is here , from young to old .
BLAKE:  Easter's a good day for reunions . The family goes to church together .
ALEX:  And after church they come here for lunch ?
BLAKE:  Yup , a big potluck buffet . And then-notice there are no children around ?
ALEX:  Yeah , what's up with that ?
BLAKE:  The kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . Hide away , Yi-jun !
ALEX: Hi ! I'm happy you could make it .
BLAKE:  Well , I've been looking forward to seeing you .
ALEX:  What can I get you ?
BLAKE:  I'd love a gin and tonic .
ALEX: Could you please help me to check out the book ?
BLAKE:  Sure , what's the author's name , please .
ALEX:  I can't remember that clearly . It probably be Charles ...
BLAKE:  Charles Dickens ?
ALEX:  No , no , no . I'm not interested in literature .
BLAKE:  OK , do you know the title of the book ?
ALEX:  Oh , sorry . I'm always absent-minded . I remember that I've put a note in my pocket .
BLAKE:  So , show me the note please .
ALEX:  I can't find it now .
BLAKE:  Oh , such bad luck , sir . Can you please name the category of the book ?
ALEX:  Let me see . It's not fiction . It's biography .
BLAKE:  OK , I'll search it for you . A moment , please .
ALEX:  Thanks .
ALEX: How do you decide what grade we get ?
BLAKE:  I look at many things , attendance , quizzes , and tests .
ALEX:  What is the most important factor ?
BLAKE:  Obviously I look for improvement as we go along , but I would like you to do your best from the beginning .
ALEX:  How can we keep track of our grades ?
BLAKE:  The final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade ; homework , attendance , and quizzes total 60 percent .
ALEX:  What if we can't get to school ?
BLAKE:  You can only miss one class without penalty .
ALEX:  If we have a major problem , will you let us know ?
BLAKE:  I will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem .
ALEX: We're thinking about going to America .
BLAKE:  Have you thought about the cost ?
ALEX:  There is that .
BLAKE:  I believe it'll be very expensive .
ALEX: May I help you with something ?
BLAKE:  I would like to return some books .
ALEX:  I ’ ll take them .
BLAKE:  Here you go .
ALEX:  These books were due two weeks ago .
BLAKE:  Yeah . I totally forgot they were due .
ALEX:  You will need to pay late fees on these books .
BLAKE:  How much are the late fees ?
ALEX:  The fee is 25 cents every day .
BLAKE:  I have to pay 25 cents a day ?
ALEX:  And that ’ s for each book that is late .
BLAKE:  That shouldn ’ t be a problem .
ALEX: This is such a beautiful day ! Great for sailing !
BLAKE:  It sure is ! The water looks so nice ! Anchor the boat for a little while . I ’ m going to take a dip .
ALEX:  Why are you doggy-paddling ? I taught you how to swim ! Do your breast stroke !
BLAKE:  I get too tired ! I ’ ll just backstroke , it ’ s easier !
ALEX:  Try kicking your legs more . That ’ s good . Don ’ t go out too far !
BLAKE:  It ’ s fine . Jump in !
ALEX:  Kathy ! Get back here ! I see a shark !
BLAKE:  Ahahah ! ! ! Help me ! Help ! Bring the boat closer ! The shark is coming straight towards me !
ALEX:  It ’ s right under you ! Kathy ! ! !
ALEX: what was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ?
BLAKE:  my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate .
ALEX:  three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive !
BLAKE:  well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive .
ALEX:  were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ?
BLAKE:  I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood .
ALEX:  did your husband's family get to meet your family ?
BLAKE:  my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t
ALEX:  that makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ?
BLAKE:  we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa .
ALEX:  you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ?
BLAKE:  not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly !
ALEX: Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ?
BLAKE:  I'd love to , the movies are smash hit .
ALEX:  Then let's go in .
BLAKE:  I can't . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late .
ALEX:  I'll say the movie's starting in the minute .
BLAKE:  I know . I wonder what's keeping him .
ALEX:  Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , a number of times .
ALEX:  What's he trying to pull anyway .
BLAKE:  I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw .
ALEX:  Maybe you should start seeing someone else .
BLAKE:  You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy .
ALEX: So , you ’ re applying for a B2 visa , where is your final destination and what ’ s the purpose of your trip to the United States ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m going to visit my brother . he ’ s just had a baby . He lives in Minneapolis .
ALEX:  And how long do you you plan to remain in the United States ?
BLAKE:  I ’ ll be here for approximately three weeks . See , here ’ s my return ticket for the twenty-sixth of March .
ALEX:  And , who is sponsoring your trip ?
BLAKE:  My brother , here , this is an invitation letter from him . I will stay with him and his family in their home .
ALEX:  Alright , tell me about the ties you have to your home country .
BLAKE:  Well , I own a house . actually , I ’ m leaving my dog there with my neighbors . I have a car at home , and oh , my job ! I ’ m employed by Tornal as an engineer . Actually , I only have three weeks ’ vacation , so I have to go back to work at the end of March .
ALEX:  And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ?
BLAKE:  Well , I do have assets in my country . like I said , I own a house , and see , here ’ s a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance .
ALEX:  I ’ m sorry , sir , we cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time , instead , you are granted a resident visa ! Congratulations , you are the millionth person to apply for a visa ! You win ! Congratulations !
ALEX: Good afternoon , madam . How can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Well , I am a bit out of shape . I'm thinking about getting some exercises to keep fit .
ALEX:  Oh , that's good news for us .
BLAKE:  So what do you provide ?
ALEX:  First of all , we'll design a custom-made work-out plan according to your habits .
BLAKE:  How can you get that done ?
ALEX:  Well , we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified . And he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan for your needs .
BLAKE:  What else ?
ALEX:  Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal .
BLAKE:  Sounds pretty good . What about the charge ?
ALEX:  That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year .
BLAKE:  Maybe one month . Just have a try first . Not too tough at the beginning .
ALEX:  Wise decision . You'll find it's totally worth it .
ALEX: Do you watch a lot of TV ?
BLAKE:  Not really . I could take it or leave it .
ALEX:  Not me . I have to have my TV and watch whatever comes on .
BLAKE:  How can you do that ?
ALEX: Hi . What's your name ?
BLAKE:  My name is Jung Min . What's your name ?
ALEX:  My name is Jessica . It's nice to meet you .
BLAKE:  Yes . It's nice to meet you too . Are you a new student too ?
ALEX:  No . I'm a sophomore . I take it you are a new student ?
BLAKE:  Yeah . It's pretty exciting to be here .
ALEX:  Have fun while it lasts . The excitement wears off real quick . Especially after you see how much homework you get . Where are you from ?
BLAKE:  I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here .
ALEX:  I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea .
BLAKE:  Why were you in Japan ?
ALEX:  My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures .
BLAKE:  That's pretty cool .
ALEX:  I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents .
BLAKE:  Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around .
ALEX:  Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class .
BLAKE:  Ok .
ALEX: Guess who I saw just now ?
BLAKE:  Who ?
ALEX:  John Smith , the escaped criminal .
BLAKE:  That bad egg , who took the low road since he was a boy .
ALEX:  I think I must report to the cops .
BLAKE:  Ok .
ALEX: What do you think of this one ?
BLAKE:  Eh , so so .
ALEX:  And this one ? Too flashy ?
BLAKE:  Nah , not too flashy .
ALEX:  Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ’ t it hideous ?
BLAKE:  I guess .
ALEX:  Are you even listening ? I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you .
BLAKE:  And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes !
ALEX:  Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon !
BLAKE:  Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first !
ALEX:  Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
BLAKE:  Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
ALEX:  I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game !
ALEX: Hello . Nice to see you again . I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . I hope everything ’ s OK .
BLAKE:  Yes , fine . I had something wrong with my stomach . I won ’ t go into detail , but it wasn ’ t serious .
ALEX:  I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital .
BLAKE:  I think most people are a little nervous about it . I was really very , very nervous just before I had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation .
ALEX:  It must have really hurt afterwards .
BLAKE:  Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing .
ALEX:  I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital .
BLAKE:  I certainly was ! However , the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn ’ t eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list !
ALEX:  Is there any pain now ?
BLAKE:  No , not at all . I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days .
ALEX:  Did they take good care of you in the hospital ?
BLAKE:  Oh , yes . The nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what I could drink . In the end , I just drank water and nothing else . Everyone was very professional and I actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay .
ALEX: How was the party ?
BLAKE:  I had a fantastic time .
ALEX: Hi , Monica , how is everything going ?
BLAKE:  Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job .
ALEX:  Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ?
BLAKE:  I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-depth research before I send my application letters out .
ALEX:  That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application .
BLAKE:  Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later .
ALEX:  Ok , good luck to you .
ALEX: Henry married Rose only after her father's money , didn't he ?
BLAKE:  Yeah . But he soon feel regretted for it .
ALEX:  But he seems to be very happy with Rose .
BLAKE:  He is more nice than wise .
ALEX: Hello , is that Cathy speaking ?
BLAKE:  Yes , is that you , Allen ?
ALEX:  Yes , how are you doing ?
BLAKE:  Not bad .
ALEX:  Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening.Would you like to come with me ?
BLAKE:  Sure.Thank you very much .
ALEX:  Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty.OK ?
BLAKE:  Ok , see you .
ALEX:  See you .
ALEX: The weather has been terrible this week .
BLAKE:  Yeah , I'm worried . If it's like this tomorrow , our big outdoor party will have to be canceled .
ALEX:  Let's hope it clears up .
ALEX: Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , I'm afraid so .
ALEX:  If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude .
BLAKE:  Yes , it is annoying .
ALEX: Hi , Mr . Smith . what's new ?
BLAKE:  Nothing particular . But , ...
ALEX:  What's the matter ?
BLAKE:  I , I don't know how to explain it to you .
ALEX:  Go ahead . It's nothing serious . We are good friends , aren't we ?
BLAKE:  Yes , of course . But I'm afraid I can't tell you .
ALEX: How do you do ?
BLAKE:  How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Ms . Smith . I ’ m Jack Stevens from the Marketing Department . Here is my card .
ALEX:  It ’ s nice to meet you , Mr . Stevens .
BLAKE:  Please call me Jack . Have a seat , please .
ALEX:  Thank you .
ALEX: Thanks for your hospitality .
BLAKE:  You're welcome .
ALEX: I'm terribly sorry to have caused you so much trouble .
BLAKE:  That's all right .
ALEX: Hey , what's new ?
BLAKE:  Not much . Just sitting here eating some Chinese food . Is that the paper ? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ?
ALEX:  Ok , wait a minute ... let's see . I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me .
BLAKE:  What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ?
ALEX:  Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful .
BLAKE:  That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day .
ALEX:  But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope .
ALEX: Lily , can you take part in our picnic this weekend ?
BLAKE:  That sounds great . Where are you going ?
ALEX:  I think we can go to the river , go around and have supper .
BLAKE:  What should I bring ?
ALEX:  Nothing . Just wear comfortable clothes and good shoes for walking . We'll bring everything .
ALEX: What do you think of doctor Thomson ?
BLAKE:  I feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter's disease .
ALEX:  How can you be so sure ?
BLAKE:  I can tell form the way he spoke to us .
ALEX:  Never believe his words .
ALEX: Should we ask Jason to play ? He's always watching movies on HBO .
BLAKE:  I guess we should invite him . I just hope he doesn't start talking about Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger again .
ALEX:  Oh , come on ! The game is better with three people . Anyway , if we don't ask him to play , he'll be mad .
BLAKE:  Yeah , you're right . We'll never hear the end of it .
ALEX: What do you think about violence in movies ?
BLAKE:  Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch .
ALEX:  But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ?
BLAKE:  If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun .
ALEX: Are you free tomorrow night ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I am .
ALEX:  Shall we have dinner together ?
BLAKE:  Do you have a special restaurant in mind ?
ALEX:  Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food .
BLAKE:  OK . I'll be happy to join you .
ALEX: If only our company prescribe flex time .
BLAKE:  The board has been considering introducing flex time .
ALEX:  Good news . Ah , what if be even better if alternative work place is provided .
BLAKE:  Then our entire job could be done by telecommuting .
ALEX: Brian , do you know how to speak English ?
BLAKE:  Yes .
ALEX:  Where did you learn ?
BLAKE:  I learned in college .
ALEX:  You speak really well .
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX:  How long have you been in the U . S . ?
BLAKE:  3 weeks .
ALEX:  Is your wife with you ?
BLAKE:  Yes , she just got here yesterday .
ALEX:  Have you been to California before ?
BLAKE:  No . I've never been there .
ALEX:  Have you ever been to Las Vegas ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I went there once on a business trip .
ALEX: How are the children doing at sport ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age .
ALEX:  He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ?
BLAKE:  He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone his age .
ALEX:  Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?
BLAKE:  The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
ALEX:  How are they at swimming ?
BLAKE:  They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
ALEX:  Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
BLAKE:  I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height !
ALEX:  I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher .
BLAKE:  It seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further .
ALEX: Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ?
BLAKE:  Yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day .
ALEX:  Good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time .
BLAKE:  Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ...
ALEX:  Is everything ready now ?
BLAKE:  Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive .
ALEX:  Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .
BLAKE:  Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet .
ALEX:  It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
BLAKE:  That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
ALEX:  I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available .
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX:  My pleasure .
ALEX: Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?
BLAKE:  Sorry , I thought you knew .
ALEX:  But you should have told me you were in love with her .
BLAKE:  Didn't I ?
ALEX:  You know you didn't .
BLAKE:  Well , I'm telling you now .
ALEX:  Yes , but you might have told me before .
BLAKE:  I didn't think you'd be interested .
ALEX:  You can't be serious.How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
BLAKE:  Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .
ALEX:  Oh , you men ! You're all the same .
ALEX: Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ?
BLAKE:  Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic .
ALEX:  What about water pollution instead of pollution ?
ALEX: How ’ s it going ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m fine . Thank you .
ALEX:  Do you need anything ?
BLAKE:  I need you to help me .
ALEX:  What can I do for you ?
BLAKE:  I am looking for an article in a newspaper .
ALEX:  Did you check the periodicals ?
BLAKE:  I didn ’ t even bother to think of that .
ALEX:  I ’ ll show you where to find your article .
BLAKE:  I get lost in this library .
ALEX:  It ’ s right this way .
BLAKE:  Thanks a lot for your help .
ALEX: How about eating out for a drink with me tonight .
BLAKE:  Tonight ? I'm afraid I can't . I've promised Mark to go to the gym . Can we make it tomorrow ?
ALEX:  No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ?
BLAKE:  All right . See you tomorrow night .
ALEX: Hi , Helen ! how is it going ?
BLAKE:  I'm very busy these days . It seems I can never finish my work .
ALEX:  Well , take it easy ! Don't let it get on top of you .
BLAKE:  I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now .
ALEX:  Why don't you take a few days off ?
BLAKE:  I can't . I am really behind of my work .
ALEX: Can you speak Japanese ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I can , but not very well .
ALEX:  Where did you learn it ?
BLAKE:  At school . And I'm still learning it now .
ALEX:  How long have you been learning it ?
BLAKE:  About three years .
ALEX:  Can you speak any other languages ?
BLAKE:  I'm afraid not .
ALEX: Good afternoon , Johnson .
BLAKE:  Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ?
ALEX:  Not bad , thanks .
ALEX: I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime !
BLAKE:  God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ?
ALEX:  Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day .
BLAKE:  They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest .
ALEX:  I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project .
BLAKE:  You'd better pay more attention to your health .
ALEX:  I will , thanks for your concern .
BLAKE:  You're welcome .
ALEX: It is too bad today .
BLAKE:  What happened ?
ALEX:  My som was lost . I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping , but he ignored it .
BLAKE:  How did you find him at last ?
ALEX:  It was the police wo helped me to do that .
BLAKE:  It must have taught you a lesson this time .
ALEX: I want to give our kitchen the works .
BLAKE:  Why ? I think it ’ s convenient and good .
ALEX:  No . The decoration has been out-of-date . My friends have a whole kitchen now . It ’ s modern .
BLAKE:  Why should we run after the fashion ?
ALEX:  I am not running after the fashion . I just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen .
ALEX: Rock music really leaves me cold . What about you ?
BLAKE:  I'm crazy about it.It makes me very excited .
ALEX:  Then tell me what's good about it .
BLAKE:  It can't be expressed by words .
ALEX: What's wrong with Debbie today ? She seems upset about something .
BLAKE:  I have no idea . Maybe she had a fight with her husband .
ALEX: Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one .
BLAKE:  Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal .
ALEX:  Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
BLAKE:  I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
ALEX: Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ?
BLAKE:  Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well .
ALEX:  Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion .
BLAKE:  That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic .
ALEX:  Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert .
BLAKE:  Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner .
ALEX: Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?
BLAKE:  What ? Why do we have to do that ?
ALEX:  Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .
BLAKE:  I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !
ALEX:  That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich !
BLAKE:  That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time !
ALEX: I would like to watch the Oscars on tv tonight . How about you ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I ‘ d love to . it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
ALEX:  I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .
BLAKE:  Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ?
ALEX:  I ‘ m really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders .
BLAKE:  You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ?
ALEX:  You might think this strange , but I like the category for best foreign language film .
BLAKE:  It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the best actor and actress .
ALEX: How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ?
BLAKE:  We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education .
ALEX:  Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job .
BLAKE:  But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things .
ALEX: How do you celebrate national day in your country ?
BLAKE:  There are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building .
ALEX:  What kinds of parades are there ?
BLAKE:  The parades are usually military ones , but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs . What do you do on national day in your country ?
ALEX:  We don ’ t have a national day .
BLAKE:  Really ? That ’ s unusual .
ALEX:  I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don ’ t .
BLAKE:  Actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . In the evening , many people watch special TV shows which celebrate national day .
ALEX: Hi Melissa , are you going home this weekend ?
BLAKE:  No , not this weekend . I have too much work to do .
ALEX:  Where do your parents live ?
BLAKE:  My father lives in Washington DC .
ALEX:  How about your mother ?
BLAKE:  My mother died two years ago .
ALEX:  Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Is your father still working ?
BLAKE:  No , he's retired .
ALEX:  Do you have any family here ?
BLAKE:  Yes , two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here .
ALEX:  Do you have any brothers or sisters ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I have two brothers who live in New York and a sister who lives in Boston .
ALEX:  Do you see them a lot ?
BLAKE:  Not as much as I'd like to . Usually just on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas .
ALEX: Hey , how was the show ?
BLAKE:  Not great . It's a kind of boring .
ALEX:  Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great .
BLAKE:  Yes , me too . But I'm disappointed .
ALEX: What happened , John ?
BLAKE:  Nothing .
ALEX:  Why do you look unhappy ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off .
ALEX:  Oh , cheer up . He ’ ll understand you .
BLAKE:  I hope so .
ALEX: You know that ? Joan has got the scholarship .
BLAKE:  Really ?
ALEX:  But I think Henry is a backroom boy.He always helps her with her study .
BLAKE:  You're right .
ALEX: Hi , Tina , I ’ Ve got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising .
BLAKE:  That is awesome . Congratulation ! I know you can make it .
ALEX:  Thanks . Let ’ s go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ?
BLAKE:  Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . See 5PM , ok ?
ALEX:  No problem . See you !
BLAKE:  See you !
ALEX: Do you like ethnic food ?
BLAKE:  I do ! My favorites are Mexican , Thai , and Indian .
ALEX:  Really ? Have you ever tried Moroccan ?
BLAKE:  I can't say that I have . What are the basic ingredients ?
ALEX:  I don't know . A friend of mine said I should try it .
BLAKE:  Do you know where a Moroccan restaurant is ?
ALEX:  As a matter of fact , he gave me this address .
BLAKE:  Let's go there for lunch ! I'm up for an adventure !
ALEX: Nicole , your Fettucini is very ... unique .
BLAKE:  But not as good as your mother's , right ?
ALEX:  Actually , it's better ...
BLAKE:  What ? Are you kidding ?
ALEX:  No . It was the only dish she wasn't good at . So we could use you as the new head chef ...
BLAKE:  Oh , Uncle Giovanni . That's wonderful ! Thank you ! Thank you !
ALEX:  OK , OK . Get back to work . There's someone waiting for you in the kitchen ...
ALEX: How many people are there in your family ?
BLAKE:  Five.My father , mother , brother , sister-in-law and me .
ALEX:  Is your brother older or younger than you ?
BLAKE:  He is five years older than me , He got married last Sunday.My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age .
ALEX: Hello , Tom . Where are you heading for ?
BLAKE:  I am going to a movie theater . You know there is a new action film produced by Hollywood . A thriller , really .
ALEX:  Another terror film ? There is too much terror and violence in the films . Do you like seeing such a picture ?
BLAKE:  I don't really like seeing bloody frames , but I appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects .
ALEX: Did you go to the concert last weekend ?
BLAKE:  No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ?
ALEX:  Yes . I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist .
BLAKE:  How much was the ticket ?
ALEX:  I only paid two dollars for mine .
ALEX: Mary and Tom are breaking up .
BLAKE:  It's unbelievable ! They are only married for one month . Then who is at fault ?
ALEX:  Mary said she couldn't put up with Tom , for he fell in love with another woman .
BLAKE:  Do you think they'll become reconciled ?
ALEX:  No , I don't think so . She said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage .
BLAKE:  What a shame ! Their marriage is really a mistake .
ALEX: have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ?
BLAKE:  sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality .
ALEX:  as far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?
BLAKE:  to begin with , I have to use chopsticks .
ALEX:  but you look quite proficient in using them now .
BLAKE:  certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch
ALEX:  yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm i
BLAKE:  anything strang about that ?
ALEX:  maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present .
BLAKE:  oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks .
ALEX: It really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens . I even want to wring his neck .
BLAKE:  Don't be so angry . It's passed anyway .
ALEX:  I can't forget it .
BLAKE:  You'd better cool yourself down first .
ALEX: Let's program your courses . Since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction.You transcript indicate that your English background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it .
BLAKE:  How many credits for each course ?
ALEX:  Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department .
BLAKE:  Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will .
ALEX: I hate to go outside .
BLAKE:  Me too .
ALEX:  Why do you hate to go outside ?
BLAKE:  I meet too many jerks .
ALEX:  I agree .
BLAKE:  This city is full of jerks .
ALEX:  Rude people are everywhere .
BLAKE:  But what can you do ?
ALEX:  You can yell at them .
BLAKE:  And they will yell back at you .
ALEX:  Yelling doesn't do any good .
BLAKE:  No . The best thing to do is just stay home .
ALEX: I had to announce his innocence in court today , but it left a nasty taste in my mouth .
BLAKE:  You mean you suspect him .
ALEX:  I ’ m not sure . I ’ ll try to prove my feeling .
BLAKE:  I hope I can do something for you .
ALEX: Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature .
BLAKE:  You do ?
ALEX:  Yeah , those classics from the great writers .
BLAKE:  But I find Japanese ones better .
ALEX: Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not .
BLAKE:  Why doesn't he ask her ?
ALEX:  He is too scared to ask her .
BLAKE:  He's a chicken guy .
ALEX: Good morning .
BLAKE:  Good morning .
ALEX:  What does the paper say ?
BLAKE:  Nothing much — the same old stuff . A lot of bad news as usual .
ALEX:  Well , what ’ s the weather report ?
BLAKE:  Sunny and mild today , cloudy and rainy tomorrow .
ALEX:  Did they find those bank robbers ?
BLAKE:  Not yet . They were holding two men in Ohio , but they let them go . They weren ’ t the criminals after all .
ALEX:  What about the sports page ? What were the scores of last night ’ s games ?
BLAKE:  Here ’ s the paper ; you can read them yourself .
ALEX: I would wondering if you like to stay here for a few days .
BLAKE:  It really depends on when and how long
ALEX:  Until next weekend . that ’ s ok .
ALEX: They ’ ll do the operation for you this Friday .
BLAKE:  But Saturday is my birthday .
ALEX:  I think it ’ s important to do now . We can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital .
BLAKE:  But it won ’ t be on my birthday .
ALEX:  But your health is more important . Believe me !
ALEX: I hate computer games .
BLAKE:  Why ? They are fine .
ALEX:  Because they are too violent . Some of them are even disgusting .
BLAKE:  Indeed there are bad games . But many of them are good .
ALEX:  If boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad .
BLAKE:  Come on . Things are not so bad . Boys can learn to use the computer through games .
ALEX: Are you free this weekend , Miss Rose ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I am . What's up ?
ALEX:  Then would you please go to a dance party with me ?
BLAKE:  With pleasure . I suppose you dance often .
ALEX:  Oh , no . As a matter of fact , I haven't danced for a long time .
BLAKE:  But I am told that you dance wonderfully well .
ALEX:  Thanks for flattering me . I think you dance a lot , right ?
BLAKE:  No . Just occasionally .
ALEX:  What's your favorite dance ?
BLAKE:  It's hard to say , but I do love the foxtrot and waltz .
ALEX:  How about rock'n'roll ?
BLAKE:  To tell you the truth , I don't like it . It's too noisy .
ALEX:  And the tango ?
BLAKE:  Oh , it's really beautiful , but I just can't do it well .
ALEX:  Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can do it very well . Then I'll meet you at six . Is that at all right ?
BLAKE:  OK .
ALEX:  Great ! I'm your lucky fellow then .
ALEX: You are an outgoing person , quite easy to talk with .
BLAKE:  Yes , my friends like to get along with me well .
ALEX:  Do you have many friends ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I like to make new friends .
ALEX:  What do you usually do with them ?
BLAKE:  We like to get together , chat and enjoy beautiful music .
ALEX: Doris , Helen Mall is having a big sale this weekend . Do you wanna go ?
BLAKE:  Don't feel like it . I'm broke .
ALEX:  Well , we can still do some window shopping , can we ?
BLAKE:  Just look around ? Nah , that ’ s boring .
ALEX:  I'll go by myself then .
ALEX: I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day .
BLAKE:  Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink .
ALEX:  How about the new bar across the road ?
BLAKE:  Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too .
ALEX:  I agree , I had lunch there last week .
BLAKE:  Excellent ! That sounds like a plan .
ALEX: Hello , are you Chinese ?
BLAKE:  No , I'm Korean . Where are you from ?
ALEX:  I'm from America . Are you settling in all right ?
BLAKE:  I've already found a flat and it's quite comfortable . What about you ?
ALEX:  I live in my uncle's house . He came here ten years ago .
BLAKE:  What do you think of the local accent here ? Has it been causing you any problems ?
ALEX:  I think it's just a matter of getting used to it .
BLAKE:  I can't agree more .
ALEX: Why don't you watch where you're going ?
BLAKE:  Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me !
ALEX:  There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .
BLAKE:  Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me .
ALEX:  I think my arm is broken .
BLAKE:  Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too .
ALEX:  Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was .
BLAKE:  Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .
ALEX:  I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?
BLAKE:  Alright .
ALEX:  It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .
BLAKE:  Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .
ALEX:  Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .
BLAKE:  Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .
ALEX:  It really hurts .
BLAKE:  Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?
ALEX:  To hell with you . The accident was your fault .
BLAKE:  I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?
ALEX:  To hell with you .
ALEX: Bill , do you know if the cafeteria around the corner's open today ?
BLAKE:  Yes . They were open this morning when I came to work . They must've finished remodeling . Why do you want to know ?
ALEX:  Well , I thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today . That is , if you haven't promised to go with someone else .
BLAKE:  That'd be wonderful , Peter . But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning .
ALEX:  I'm sorry I was such a grouch . It must've been the weather . When it rains I get depressed .
BLAKE:  Forget it . I'll see you at 11:30 am .
ALEX: The stepmother was very wicked . She couldn't stand a happy smile on the boy's face .
BLAKE:  And ?
ALEX:  And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
BLAKE:  Poor child !
ALEX: Sorry . I didn't mean to be late . Can I come in ?
BLAKE:  What's your excuse this time ?
ALEX:  Have I used the one that my sister is sick ?
BLAKE:  Yes , twice last week .
ALEX:  Are you sure ? I thought I said it was my mother .
BLAKE:  I don't think so . But it could've been .
ALEX:  Well . You can trust me this time . My sister is definitely sick . I'm just coming from the hospital . They say she might even die .
BLAKE:  I don't buy your story . Try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ?
ALEX:  I'll do my best .
BLAKE:  Just try to be a little more punctual in the future .
ALEX:  I'm working on it . Really !
ALEX: Hi , Becky , what's up ?
BLAKE:  Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall .
ALEX:  What's the problem ?
BLAKE:  She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she ' s around .
ALEX:  For example ?
BLAKE:  Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .
ALEX:  No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
BLAKE:  It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .
ALEX:  My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .
ALEX: Ella , it's been such a long week . I'm ready to go out and party . Hey , let's go out for a night on the town .
BLAKE:  Gosh , you took all the word right out of my mouth . Let's go out and get crazy tonight .
ALEX:  Let's go to the new club on West Street .
BLAKE:  Sure , but what do I wear ?
ALEX:  You can wear that pretty red dress .
ALEX: Hi , Alice , what are you doing this sunday ?
BLAKE:  Nothing really , why , what ' s up ?
ALEX:  If you are free , maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . It will be fun , you will get to know lots of people .
BLAKE:  Sounds great , I'd very much like to accept your invitation , thanks , when ?
ALEX:  Around six pm .
BLAKE:  Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating .
ALEX:  No . thank you . I can handle it , but thanks for the offer .
BLAKE:  Ok , I will see you then .
ALEX:  Great , have a good day , thanks again for the offer .
ALEX: Hello.this is Susan .
BLAKE:  Hello , I ’ m Mark . I ’ m just wondering if you are free this weekend
ALEX:  Yes , I think So .
BLAKE:  Good . I was thinking that I ’ d like to invite you to watch a movie . I can meet you at the cinema gate .
ALEX:  What ’ s the time ?
BLAKE:  Six thirty , tonight .
ALEX:  Oh , I ’ m sorry I can ’ t because I have to do some housework.You can ask Jenny to go with you
BLAKE:  All right.Maybe next time I can go with you.Bye !
ALEX:  Good bye !
ALEX: What is life ?
BLAKE:  Don't ask such a question . You know it has no certain answer . Everyone knows it is in his heart .
ALEX:  Then do you think that life is arranged by something above us .
BLAKE:  Maybe , the whirligig of time , who knows ?
ALEX:  Right .
ALEX: David , I ’ m going to China .
BLAKE:  Really ? How did you get the chance ?
ALEX:  You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ’ t have to pay for my trip .
BLAKE:  Congratulations . How lucky you are !
ALEX:  Thank you . I ’ m leaving tomorrow morning .
BLAKE:  I ’ m sure you ’ ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country .
ALEX:  I ’ m sure I will .
BLAKE:  Have a nice journey , Lily .
ALEX:  Thank you , David .
ALEX: Did you watch the final last night ? My favorite singer won !
BLAKE:  Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .
ALEX:  Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .
BLAKE:  He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him .
ALEX:  Me too .
BLAKE:  Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .
ALEX:  Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?
BLAKE:  Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited .
ALEX:  He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .
BLAKE:  And the host announced that he won it all !
ALEX: Come in , come in !
BLAKE:  Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ?
ALEX:  I thought we were supposed to meet here .
BLAKE:  Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment .
ALEX:  I ’ m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other .
BLAKE:  Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ?
ALEX:  You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie .
BLAKE:  It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning .
ALEX: Excuse me , i am a new student here . Could you tell me where the English Department is ?
BLAKE:  It is in that brand new , tall building over there . On the 9th floor .
ALEX:  Where is the school cafeteria ?
BLAKE:  It is the basement of that red building in front of the tower with big bells .
ALEX:  Where is the Computer Center ?
BLAKE:  The Computer Center is on the first floor of the library .
ALEX:  Where is the library ?
BLAKE:  The library is next to the Adminstration Building . The Adminstration Building is over there near the school ’ s main entrance . There are school maps for free in the lobby of the Admin .
ALEX:  Thank you . I will go get one .
BLAKE:  Sure . Glad to be of service . By the way , my name is Mike Sullivan . You will see me around a lot . I am running for President of the Student Government .
ALEX:  Well , hi ! My name is Eve Markowski . I am glad to meet you . With your friendly smile and helpful attitude . I am sure you will win .
BLAKE:  Thanks you for the encouragement .
ALEX:  You are welcome . I ’ d better go . Goodbye .
BLAKE:  Have a good day . Bye-Bye !
ALEX: How about another beer ?
BLAKE:  No , thanks . I've had more than enough.In fact , I must be running along .
ALEX:  Stay around for a while.The party is warming up .
BLAKE:  I'm afraid I have to leave . I have to be up early tomorrow .
ALEX: We have another traditional holiday-the Dragon Boat Festival .
BLAKE:  When is it ?
ALEX:  It falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month .
BLAKE:  Could you tell me the origin of the two festivals ?
ALEX:  OK . The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan . On that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river .
BLAKE:  Why do people eat rice cakes on that day ?
ALEX:  In order to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body .
BLAKE:  It sounds so moving .
ALEX: Nice to see you , Patrick .
BLAKE:  Bob ! I hear your team won the match .
ALEX:  Yeah . All of us tried our best .
BLAKE:  Congratulations !
ALEX: I think you're being a little naive .
BLAKE:  If I want , I can protect myself by paying through an escrow account , which holds the money until I receive the item .
ALEX:  That proves my point ! Protect yourself or you'll get burned .
BLAKE:  eBay also offers free insurance . You can get a refund of up to $ 200 if you're not satisfied with your purchase .
ALEX:  $ 200 ? If they get a hold of your credit card number , you're going to be out a lot more than $ 200 ! I had a friend who ...
ALEX: Your knowledge of English is really surprising .
BLAKE:  Oh , it's nothing to speak of .
ALEX:  No , seriously . I am impressed .
BLAKE:  Thank you . I appreciate the compliment .
ALEX: Hello ?
BLAKE:  Hey Tina . What are you doing ?
ALEX:  I was just watching TV . What's going on with you ?
BLAKE:  I just watched a movie and I'm scared .
ALEX:  What did you watch ?
BLAKE:  I saw the Sixth Sense . I didn't know it was going to be so scary .
ALEX:  I remember that . It was a great movie . But it was definitely scary .
BLAKE:  If you're not busy , do you want to come over ? I'm afraid to be alone .
ALEX:  Sure . I can come over . What should we do ?
BLAKE:  How about if we watch a comedy . I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense .
ALEX:  Ok . I'll get ready and leave . I'll see you in about 20 minutes .
BLAKE:  Hurry , ok . It's dark out .
ALEX:  Don't worry , nothings going to happen . I'll be there real soon .
BLAKE:  Ok . See you soon .
ALEX: are you a blogger ?
BLAKE:  sure I am . I've been writing a blog for almost three years .
ALEX:  oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ?
BLAKE:  I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides .
ALEX:  what do you usually write about ?
BLAKE:  at first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my family an
ALEX:  that's interesting . How often do you write a blog ?
BLAKE:  it's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks .
ALEX:  got it . Are you still updating your blog ?
BLAKE:  sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like .
ALEX:  good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months .
ALEX: Have you found a new job yet ?
BLAKE:  No , not yet . I ’ m still looking . I ’ Ve been doing some work through a temp-agency though .
ALEX:  What kind of work ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m temping at a pharmaceutic company .
ALEX:  What do you do there ?
BLAKE:  Mostly office work - filing and so on .
ALEX:  How long is the assignment ?
BLAKE:  Till the end of the month .
ALEX: This is just for you . Cheers ! Bottoms up .
BLAKE:  En ... it tastes good . I appreciate what you have done for me .
ALEX: I'm sorry , ladies . Mr . Smith's viewing is over . It ended an hour ago .
BLAKE:  But we just drove across town . Can't we just go in to see him one last ...
ALEX:  I'm afraid not . But at tomorrow's funeral , the family requested an open casket service .
BLAKE:  This is all too fast . He's my best friend , and now he's gone .
ALEX:  I'm sorry . I know it must have come as a great shock .
BLAKE:  The viewing was for saying goodbye , and I didn't even get that .
ALEX: I can ’ t bear it . The driver is too bad .
BLAKE:  He must be green . It ’ s lucky that we will get off soon .
ALEX: I prefer potatoes to eggplants .
BLAKE:  I feel eggplants are more nutritious .
ALEX:  But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .
BLAKE:  Oh , that's how you see it .
ALEX: That way they look longer .
BLAKE:  Now what are you doing ?
ALEX:  Putting on mascara .
BLAKE:  Nasty . You'd better not rub your eyes .
ALEX:  I won't .
BLAKE:  And you'd better not cry or you'll have black streaks running down your face .
ALEX: Let's have some lunch ; do you know of a great restaurant somewhere ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I'm hungry . What types of food sound good ?
ALEX:  Maybe just a quick sandwich , salad , or something .
BLAKE:  I have a great idea of where you might like to go .
ALEX:  Can we walk there ?
BLAKE:  It's on the second floor . May I join you ?
ALEX:  Of course ! Let's go .
BLAKE:  Let's hurry . I'm starving !
ALEX: What are you going to do next year ?
BLAKE:  I want to go traveling .
ALEX:  Do you have any where in mind ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I've been thinking about Florida .
ALEX: Like a cat on hot bricks , as you might say . I don ’ t believe you are listening at all .
BLAKE:  Sorry , I just worried about him . You know , he should be here an hour ago .
ALEX:  Don ’ t worry him , he has been grown up and I think he can take himself very well .
BLAKE:  But he still does not come back .
ALEX:  Maybe he is on the way home now .
ALEX: How long have you been in England ?
BLAKE:  For almost two years .
ALEX:  Almost two years ? Your English is very good .
BLAKE:  Thank you . But there's still a lot for me to learn .
ALEX: The Johnson are on their way back.You remember them , don't you ?
BLAKE:  Johnson ? I can't place them .
ALEX:  We met them in Bermuda last May .
BLAKE:  They've completely slipped my mind .
ALEX:  The couple with the dogs , think back .
BLAKE:  No , I don't recall a thing about them .
ALEX:  Well , I've invited them for brunch .
BLAKE:  Hmm , I must be getting absent-minded .
ALEX: His grandfather is the richest person in the area .
BLAKE:  What a miser ! He cycles to school every day .
ALEX:  His grandfather's money is not his .
BLAKE:  I can't understand him anyway .
ALEX: What did he say ?
BLAKE:  He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
ALEX:  It ’ s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
BLAKE:  Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know .
ALEX: I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat.oh , there he is .
BLAKE:  hey , Isabelle ...
ALEX:  Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .
BLAKE:  yes , I am the guy ...
ALEX:  what a bummer ! You set me up ?
BLAKE:  let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ...
ALEX: We are just going round the corner for a drink . Won't you join us ?
BLAKE:  Well , I'd like to , but I am not sure I have time .
ALEX:  Oh , come on ! Just a quick one !
BLAKE:  All right , just a quick one .
ALEX: Excuse me Miao Li . Could you tell me who Jackie Chan is ?
BLAKE:  Certainly . Jackie Chan is a very famous movie star in Hong Kong . His Chinese name is Cheng Long .
ALEX:  Ha , I know Cheng Long a lot , he has made 40 films since 1976 . And at that time he was promoted as the new Bruce Lee . But I'm not familiar with his English name .
BLAKE:  OK . Then tell me what else you know .
ALEX:  Some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make . Do you know how Jackie Chan measures his worth ?
BLAKE:  He measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . By the way , can you count the breaks ?
ALEX:  Sure . His skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul-der , is chest , two fingers , a knee . As he said ' Everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet ! '
BLAKE:  Indeed you know much about him .
ALEX:  This is because he is the action-movie incarnate or action-star extraordinaire around the world .
ALEX: I'm sorry , but I can't find the book you lent me .
BLAKE:  Oh , that's all right .
ALEX:  I must apologize . I'll buy you a new one tomorrow .
BLAKE:  No , please don't . I couldn't let you do that .
ALEX: May I ask a question ?
BLAKE:  Yes , what's it ?
ALEX:  What does mph stand for ?
BLAKE:  It's miles per hour .
ALEX: Look , that bamboo groves are flourishing . Let's go and play there .
BLAKE:  Wait ! Look at that board , what's on it ?
ALEX:  ' Please don't enter the bamboo groves . ' We're not allowed to go in .
BLAKE:  Then we'd better not go .
ALEX:  OK .
ALEX: Are you ready to go shopping ?
BLAKE:  Not yet . I'm not finished with my research yet .
ALEX:  What research ?
BLAKE:  Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ?
ALEX:  But they're just ads .
BLAKE:  Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends .
ALEX: Is there anything worth watching on another channel ?
BLAKE:  I think there ’ s a Western on .
ALEX:  Do you mind if we watch it . I ’ d really like to see it .
BLAKE:  Well , I really wanted to see the football game .
ALEX:  Football game ? Ok , and you know what comes on next ?
BLAKE:  I believe there ’ s a sitcom .
ALEX:  Are you interested in watching it ?
BLAKE:  Let me look in the TV Guide first .
ALEX:  Oh , I am sorry . What's on Channel 2 at 10 pm ?
BLAKE:  If I remember correctly , it's a quiz show .
ALEX:  Do you want to watch it ?
BLAKE:  Let's watch it together .
ALEX: Well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ?
BLAKE:  It was funny .
ALEX:  Tell me about it , will you ?
BLAKE:  Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight .
ALEX:  Did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ?
BLAKE:  Sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour .
ALEX:  You were lucky then . What did you do after that ?
BLAKE:  We went for a swim in the sea . That was the best part of the day . Just look at my nice tan .
ALEX:  So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday .
BLAKE:  Yes , you're right . And I was so tired that I fell asleep on the way back . My arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday .
ALEX: Susan is going to get a divorce .
BLAKE:  How do you know that ?
ALEX:  She told me that Peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage .
BLAKE:  Oh , I see . But I think you are making a fuss . They will make it up . Bet it .
ALEX: Here's the course description guide .
BLAKE:  What do I do with it ?
ALEX:  Do you want me to help you ?
BLAKE:  Please .
ALEX:  Look . Here are the core classes . Everyone has to take them .
BLAKE:  So I don't have to worry about them .
ALEX:  You're catching on ! However , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ...
BLAKE:  I'll take home economics .
ALEX:  Good . Now you can pick classes by yourself .
ALEX: Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of your computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thoughts .
BLAKE:  But I ... I don't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to thinkbecause kids don't learn basic skills .
ALEX:  What do you mean ?
BLAKE:  They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more . that's because they rely on gadgets .
ALEX:  That's not the gadgets . Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . It engages their imagination and sharpen their mind .
ALEX: Ann , do you have time next Monday ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , what ’ s up ?
ALEX:  Next Monday is my birthday , and I would like you to attend my party .
BLAKE:  Wow . I'd love to .
ALEX:  Great !
BLAKE:  When and where ?
ALEX:  Five o ’ clock that afternoon , and in my place , you know ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I know . I appreciate your invitation .
ALEX:  I am going to invite other guys . See you that day .
BLAKE:  See you .
ALEX: Hey Stacy . What's going on ?
BLAKE:  I'm pretty tired these days .
ALEX:  Why ? You're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands ?
BLAKE:  I have so much house work to do . I have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends .
ALEX:  How about your husband . Does he help much ?
BLAKE:  Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ?
ALEX:  That sucks .
BLAKE:  If he wasn't so lazy , I think I wouldn't have any complaints . He mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ?
ALEX:  That's crossing the line .
BLAKE:  Oh well . I'll have to live with it . What else can I do ?
ALEX: Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ?
BLAKE:  Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ?
ALEX:  Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
BLAKE:  That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems .
ALEX:  Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ?
BLAKE:  When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports .
ALEX:  I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ?
BLAKE:  Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it .
ALEX:  Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo .
BLAKE:  Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits .
ALEX:  You should go to talk with May . She is a big fan of them too .
ALEX: How do you arrange this summer vacation ?
BLAKE:  I want to travel .
ALEX:  Where would you like to go ?
BLAKE:  The seaside .
ALEX:  That's really a good idea . Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian .
BLAKE:  I ’ Ve been to Qingdao before , so I ’ ll choose Dalian . I've heard that the environment there is very good .
ALEX:  Yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . Last year I went there . It's really .
BLAKE:  Thank you !
ALEX: Would you care for something to drink , Mr . Stone ?
BLAKE:  No , thank you , Mrs . Carter . I'm fine for now .
ALEX:  Just make yourself at home . The other guests should be arriving shortly .
ALEX: I'm dreadfully sorry for you .
BLAKE:  Thank you very much for your kindness .
ALEX:  Is there any clue ?
BLAKE:  No , he left nothing .
ALEX: Very glad to know something about you , then what are you going to do when you finish .
BLAKE:  Oh , I ’ ll go to shanghai to practice there .
ALEX:  That ’ s a good idea . It must be easy to find a job in shanghai .
BLAKE:  I think so , you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there .
ALEX:  And English is very useful in your job .
BLAKE:  I think it will be very useful in many ways . Beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in China , but also in the world , English is useful in almost all walks of life .
ALEX:  You will be a very promising one .
BLAKE:  That ’ s my wish .
ALEX: I hear you are expecting your family .
BLAKE:  Yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well .
ALEX:  I didn't know you had a brother .
BLAKE:  Oh , yes , he is two years older than me . He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often .
ALEX:  Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ?
BLAKE:  His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here .
ALEX:  Does your brother have just one son ?
BLAKE:  No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them .
ALEX:  I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson .
BLAKE:  Oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . They went to New Zealand last year and loved it .
ALEX:  So when are they all coming ?
BLAKE:  My parents are already here . My brother and nephew are arriving on Monday .
ALEX: You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ?
BLAKE:  I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday .
ALEX:  Where did you spend your holiday ?
BLAKE:  I went to Paris .
ALEX: So , Paula , where are you from ?
BLAKE:  I'm from Canada , originally .
ALEX:  From Canada ? Where were you born ?
BLAKE:  Montreal .
ALEX:  When did you come to Los Angeles ?
BLAKE:  We moved here when I was fourteen .
ALEX:  Did you go to school here ?
BLAKE:  Well , I went to high school here , but I went to college in Texas .
ALEX:  Did you get a job right after graduation ?
BLAKE:  No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France .
ALEX:  When was that ?
BLAKE:  Let's see ... That was about six years ago .
ALEX:  I bet that was interesting . What did you do there ?
BLAKE:  I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me.How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ?
ALEX: Do you consider yourself a good mother ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman .
ALEX:  How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother .
BLAKE:  I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself .
ALEX:  Does your husband feel the same ?
BLAKE:  Yes . He is very understanding and supportive .
ALEX: I find it really hard to express myself in class . I have lots of ideas , but they never seem to come out of my mouth .
BLAKE:  let me give you a little advice . You know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance .
ALEX:  I often do , but I ’ m worried about the responses from other people .
BLAKE:  you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion .
ALEX:  I ’ m worried that what I say will not make sense .
BLAKE:  we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking .
ALEX:  that ’ s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ?
BLAKE:  that ’ s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle .
ALEX:  I didn ’ t realize that speaking in class could be so easy .
BLAKE:  the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ’ t be sure how .
ALEX: What's his job ?
BLAKE:  He used to be a policeman .
ALEX:  But Mrs.Smith hired him to find her lost son .
BLAKE:  Yeah . He's a private eye now .
ALEX: Bother the flies !
BLAKE:  Where do they come from ?
ALEX:  I don't know . Something rotten here ?
BLAKE:  I can't see it .
ALEX: Have you got your invitation yet ?
BLAKE:  My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ?
ALEX:  The house warming party .
BLAKE:  Whose house warming party is it ?
ALEX:  Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house .
BLAKE:  Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately .
ALEX:  It's out in the suburbs .
BLAKE:  Have you seen the house ?
ALEX:  Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend .
BLAKE:  Is it nice ?
ALEX:  Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen .
BLAKE:  There's also a garden .
ALEX:  Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ?
BLAKE:  They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight .
ALEX:  When are they going to have the party ?
BLAKE:  Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow .
ALEX:  Wow , that would be something to look forward to .
ALEX: hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ?
BLAKE:  I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year .
ALEX:  oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ?
BLAKE:  we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec
ALEX:  wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait !
BLAKE:  tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ?
ALEX:  perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank .
BLAKE:  no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .
ALEX:  we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning .
BLAKE:  great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain .
ALEX:  no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week .
BLAKE:  Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us .
ALEX: Hi , Kenny . Let's go for a drink .
BLAKE:  Sounds good . Where are we going ?
ALEX:  Somewhere new . It's a great place to pick up chicks .
BLAKE:  Need a new . girlfriend , huh ?
ALEX:  Yeah , I broke up with Lisa.She blew a gasket over it . Whoa , get a load of that !
BLAKE:  Whew ! That getup is terrific !
ALEX:  Never mind the getup.She ' s beautiful !
BLAKE:  That too .
ALEX:  I'm gonna introduce myself .
BLAKE:  If you're lucky , that might do the trick .
ALEX:  Oh , oh , that tears it ! I'm getting out of here .
BLAKE:  Hold on ! What's the big hurry ?
ALEX:  My ex-girlfriend's here.If she sees me , my goose is cooked .
BLAKE:  I wanna finish my drink first . I'll meet you at Sammy's .
ALEX:  OK , catch you later .
ALEX: Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how are you ? It ’ s been such a long time !
BLAKE:  Darlene ! Indeed , it ’ s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you ’ Ve done with your hair !
ALEX:  Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret !
BLAKE:  Ha ha , come on ! Well , I ’ Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated !
ALEX:  Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know .
BLAKE:  He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course !
ALEX:  Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently .
BLAKE:  Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended .
ALEX:  Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday !
BLAKE:  But of course ! Well , it ’ s been great talking to you , but I have to get going .
ALEX:  Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee !
BLAKE:  That would be great ! Give me a call !
ALEX:  See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can ’ t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter .
ALEX: Did you already take the history exam ?
BLAKE:  Yeah . It was hard . When do you take it ?
ALEX:  I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ?
BLAKE:  Mostly on the civil war . You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr . had on American society .
ALEX:  What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ?
BLAKE:  I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not .
ALEX:  Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class .
BLAKE:  If you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go .
ALEX:  Aright . Thanks for the info . I gotta go to the library now .
BLAKE:  Good luck .
ALEX:  Thanks . See ya .
ALEX: What's the matter with you , then ? You look miserable .
BLAKE:  It's us .
ALEX:  What do you mean by " us " ?
BLAKE:  Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married . Remember ?
ALEX:  What do you mean ? We ' re talking now , aren't we ?
BLAKE:  Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together .
ALEX:  Yes . I remember . But we never used to argue . You used to think I was wonderful . Where are you going ?
BLAKE:  Back to live with my parents . That's something else I used to do before we were married . Remember ?
ALEX: Hey , Blake ! Are you still listening to Mozart ?
BLAKE:  Yes.Do you like it ?
ALEX:  It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent .
BLAKE:  Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it .
ALEX:  Is classical music your favorite ?
BLAKE:  Yes . What about you ?
ALEX:  I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .
BLAKE:  Pop music doesn't have any depth for me .
ALEX:  Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it .
BLAKE:  Did you always like pop music .
ALEX:  I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music .
BLAKE:  I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life .
ALEX:  oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play .
BLAKE:  Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy .
ALEX: It was really hard for our parents to save money when they were young .
BLAKE:  Most people were living form hand to mouth . How could they ?
ALEX:  Yeah . They simply had no extra money to save up or for other things .
BLAKE:  Fortunately , things are changing these years .
ALEX: Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon .
BLAKE:  A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ?
ALEX:  There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , I was hoping you ' d like to come with me .
BLAKE:  I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day .
ALEX:  What about sunday ?
BLAKE:  i wish i could , but it's my mums birthday .
ALEX:  Maybe next week .
BLAKE:  Much as I ' d like to , I am afraid i wont be free next week , I have a lot of work .
ALEX:  Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat .
BLAKE:  I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime .
ALEX: Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , I ’ m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains .
ALEX:  Oh , do you go hiking often ?
BLAKE:  I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature .
ALEX:  It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ?
BLAKE:  Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ?
ALEX:  Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike .
BLAKE:  Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city .
ALEX:  Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest .
BLAKE:  Well , bring him along too . We ’ ll have a great time this weekend .
ALEX:  Thanks , I ’ ll ask him .
ALEX: How upsetting ! He has been away for a week !
BLAKE:  I don't know if anything terrible has happened .
ALEX:  I have reported it to the police .
BLAKE:  We'd better prepare for the worst .
ALEX: You've heard of Bruce Jenner , haven't you ?
BLAKE:  He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ?
ALEX:  I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles .
BLAKE:  I can think of better things to dream about ...
ALEX:  Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away .
BLAKE:  That's crazy .
ALEX: Mike ! Look at the floor !
BLAKE:  What's wrong with it ?
ALEX:  What's wrong with it ? It's filthy !
BLAKE:  Oh ...
ALEX:  It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
BLAKE:  Sorry , love .
ALEX:  What are you looking for now ?
BLAKE:  My cigarettes .
ALEX:  Well , they ' re not here.They are in the dustbin .
BLAKE:  In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ?
ALEX: Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at this university ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad .
ALEX:  It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing .
BLAKE:  Are you Chinese by birth ?
ALEX:  Yes , I am . I am from Guangzhou . I am here to study international relations .
BLAKE:  How do you like it ?
ALEX:  I like it so far . But my English still needs work .
BLAKE:  I want to study Mandarin and public relations .
ALEX: Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .
BLAKE:  Sure . It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
ALEX:  Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .
BLAKE:  Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
ALEX:  You are right . But what if an avalanche happened ?
BLAKE:  They are all great skiers and very experienced . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
ALEX:  Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow here ?
BLAKE:  Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .
ALEX:  Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
BLAKE:  It's possible .
ALEX: You'll never guess what I won at work today ! - Tickets to tonight's final NBA game .
BLAKE:  Two , I hope and I hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me !
ALEX:  Of course ! And here's the best part , they are court side seats !
BLAKE:  How in the world ! Who came up with seats like that from your company ?
ALEX:  Some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team !
BLAKE:  Can't beat that ! Thank you accounting guy !
ALEX:  The game starts at seven so we'd better hustle , it's already five .
BLAKE:  What are we waiting for ? Let's go !
ALEX: Let ’ s play a game !
BLAKE:  OK ! How about Scrabble ?
ALEX:  No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is !
BLAKE:  OK !
ALEX:  Let ’ s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples !
BLAKE:  Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin !
ALEX:  Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald !
BLAKE:  Your future husband !
ALEX:  Not funny .
ALEX: As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives .
BLAKE:  It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points .
ALEX:  Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
BLAKE:  For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .
ALEX:  That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
BLAKE:  Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them .
ALEX: Lee , I'm going to get married next month .
BLAKE:  Good news ! And congratulations !
ALEX:  You are invited to my wedding .
BLAKE:  Thank you . I'll certainly be there .
ALEX: Thank you for lending me the book .
BLAKE:  Sure . But it's a very difficult one , you need to have a dictionary at your elbow .
ALEX:  But I'm not used to looking up every new word when I'm reading a novel . I only look up the most necessary ones .
ALEX: Don ’ t you agree that all the thieves should be punished by cutting off their fingers ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m afraid many people would turn thumbs down on it .
ALEX:  Don ’ t you think in that case , there wouldn ’ t be so much stealing ?
BLAKE:  Definitely . But I think it is too fierce .
ALEX: The bartender just gave the last call . Let's order another round , okay ?
BLAKE:  Sure , but let's get a pitcher this time We should be able to down it before they close .
ALEX:  That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ?
BLAKE:  It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ?
ALEX:  Yeah . I think I can find it .
BLAKE:  You're back already . That sure was quick .
ALEX:  That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me .
BLAKE:  Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . Anyway . He said it was too close to closing time .
ALEX:  Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway .
BLAKE:  Okay , let's go !
ALEX: hi , Mary ! What do you like to do in your spare time ?
BLAKE:  well , I spend a lot of time watching movies .
ALEX:  what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too .
BLAKE:  oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ?
ALEX:  actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . How about you ?
BLAKE:  art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too .
ALEX:  really impressive . These two genres are totally different .
BLAKE:  sure . I enjoy both of them very much .
ALEX:  how often do you go to the cinema ?
BLAKE:  once in a while , I suppose , I usually rent movies at Movie Salon .
ALEX:  movie salon ? where is that ?
BLAKE:  it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . I've got a membership there .
ALEX:  is it good ?
BLAKE:  yes , you can find almost all new releases there .
ALEX:  really ? Maybe I shall also sign up for its membership .
BLAKE:  why not ?
ALEX: Hey Suzie . Guess what ? I'm having a baby !
BLAKE:  Really ? That's so great . Congratulations .
ALEX:  Thanks . I'm so excited . We've been trying for 8 months now .
BLAKE:  That's really exciting . How many months are you pregnant ?
ALEX:  Three months .
BLAKE:  Are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ?
ALEX:  I want to , but Bob doesn't . He wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way .
BLAKE:  Maybe it's more exciting not knowing .
ALEX:  I'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time .
BLAKE:  There are so many things you have to prepare for .
ALEX:  I know I am going to be busy , but I know I can handle it . I have been looking forward to this day for a long long time .
BLAKE:  It really must be an exciting time for you guys .
ALEX:  Thank you so much .
ALEX: Mary seems depressed . What ’ s the matter ?
BLAKE:  She didn ’ t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ’ s hard work .
ALEX:  Poor girl !
ALEX: Believe it or not , one of the narrowest street in the world is only 49cm wide .
BLAKE:  Unbelievable ! How do people go through it ?
ALEX:  That's what I'm wondering , too .
BLAKE:  I wish I had a chance to see it with my own eyes .
ALEX: Would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow ?
BLAKE:  Much to my regret , I'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then .
ALEX:  We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ?
BLAKE:  Much as we'd like to , but we've booked up already for that time .
ALEX:  What a pity ! You can't join us .
BLAKE:  So sorry . Next time we'll go , thanks anyway .
ALEX: I'd like to invite you to dinner tonight , do you think have time ?
BLAKE:  Thank you for your inition . I'm free tonight .
ALEX:  Which kind of food do you like , chinese food , western food or sea food ?
BLAKE:  I prefer sea food .
ALEX:  ok . I'll pick up your hotel at 6 thirty pm .
BLAKE:  That's fine . I'll be waiting for you .
ALEX:  See you later .
BLAKE:  bye .
ALEX: Look ! I bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already .
BLAKE:  If that happen to me , I ’ ll take them back to the shop .
ALEX:  I did . But they said they won ’ t change them .
BLAKE:  That ’ s terrible . But if they wouldn ’ t change them , I know what I would do .
ALEX: Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ?
BLAKE:  Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it .
ALEX:  Totally agree . What is your solution ?
BLAKE:  Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy .
ALEX:  You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
BLAKE:  It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
ALEX:  But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .
BLAKE:  I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
ALEX: I am so busy today .
BLAKE:  Can I help you ?
ALEX:  I ’ m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping .
BLAKE:  I ’ ll be glad to help .
ALEX:  Or maybe make the beds .
BLAKE:  All you have to do is ask for help .
ALEX:  Thanks . That ’ s terrific !
BLAKE:  I ’ m ready and willing to help .
ALEX: The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef , so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening .
BLAKE:  Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ?
ALEX:  Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them .
BLAKE:  Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ?
ALEX:  I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves .
BLAKE:  You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different .
ALEX: You don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work .
BLAKE:  I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today .
ALEX:  Do you feel ok ?
BLAKE:  Not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu .
ALEX:  Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now .
BLAKE:  Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ?
ALEX:  You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down .
BLAKE:  Ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting .
ALEX:  Zach , what's that on your arm ?
BLAKE:  I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing .
ALEX:  It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ?
BLAKE:  Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .
ALEX:  I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go .
BLAKE:  Shouldn't we make an appointment first ?
ALEX:  We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse .
BLAKE:  Whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting !
ALEX: I can't go to your party .
BLAKE:  That's too bad .
ALEX: Do you like being a doctor ?
BLAKE:  Yes , most of the time . But , sometimes things can get difficult .
ALEX:  Can you tell me about it ?
BLAKE:  You know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . They may insist they are sick when they are not .
ALEX:  What can you do when this happens ?
BLAKE:  Not much , usually I'll just keep silent .
ALEX: Have you eaten ?
BLAKE:  Not yet .
ALEX: It's too hot to read .
BLAKE:  We'd better go out for a walk .
ALEX:  Which season do you like best ?
BLAKE:  Spring .
ALEX:  How about summer ?
BLAKE:  I dislike it most .
ALEX:  Why ?
BLAKE:  Because the hottest season is summer in a year .
ALEX:  But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
ALEX: My son came home from three years in the navy .
BLAKE:  It was a real red letter day for you .
ALEX:  Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
ALEX: John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ?
BLAKE:  Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ?
ALEX:  It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day .
BLAKE:  You forgot all of about it , didn't you ?
ALEX: I must be going .
BLAKE:  Okay . Keep in touch .
ALEX: Hi , I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle . The name is Jimmy Fox .
BLAKE:  I ’ m sorry , we have no mid-size available at the moment .
ALEX:  I don ’ t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ?
BLAKE:  Yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars .
ALEX:  But the reservation keeps the car here . That ’ s why you have the reservation .
BLAKE:  I know why we have reservations .
ALEX:  I don ’ t think you do.If you did , I ’ d have a car.See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them .
BLAKE:  But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ’ d like .
ALEX:  Fine . I ’ ll take the compact .
BLAKE:  Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ?
ALEX:  Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car .
ALEX: Do you think Tom will be elected president ?
BLAKE:  No , I think Harry will get it .
ALEX:  Let's make a bet on who gets it .
BLAKE:  OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night .
ALEX: I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday .
BLAKE:  Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer .
ALEX:  You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ?
BLAKE:  To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression .
ALEX:  But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive .
ALEX: What happened ? Why didn't he win ?
BLAKE:  Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .
ALEX:  How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
BLAKE:  If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .
ALEX:  What ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
BLAKE:  He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
ALEX:  I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
BLAKE:  They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
ALEX:  That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
BLAKE:  I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
ALEX:  Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
BLAKE:  I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
ALEX:  Let's hope so .
ALEX: Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ?
BLAKE:  That's because Americans love sitcoms .
ALEX:  Sitcoms ?
BLAKE:  Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values .
ALEX:  In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies .
BLAKE:  I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time .
ALEX: Are you interested in history ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks .
ALEX:  I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened .
BLAKE:  I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks !
ALEX:  Some people say that history repeats itself .
BLAKE:  What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ?
ALEX:  The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same .
BLAKE:  I see . I think I ’ d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .
ALEX: You're looking great .
BLAKE:  You , too .
ALEX: What's the matter , John ? you seemed to be restless today .
BLAKE:  You see , I've been offered a new job . I can't decide whether to take it or not .
ALEX:  Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice .
BLAKE:  It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging .
ALEX:  Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ?
BLAKE:  Yes , they say I would get a big sum .
ALEX:  Have you discussed it with your wife ?
BLAKE:  Yes , she leaves it to me .
ALEX:  As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary .
BLAKE:  I have to think about it .
ALEX: Sybil . Is that spelt with an I or a Y ?
BLAKE:  Both actually . S , Y , B , I , L .
ALEX:  Of course .
ALEX: I see Mike farmer has make it into the Olympic team . He beat the national record by 0.1 of a second .
BLAKE:  That ’ s great . He ’ s the best runner I ’ Ve seen this season . I ’ m sure he ’ ll win a medal at the Olympics .
ALEX:  I think you ’ re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we ’ ll win ?
BLAKE:  I really don ’ t know . I don ’ t think we ’ ll win many gold medals , but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones .
ALEX:  What do you think our chance are in other events .
BLAKE:  In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ’ ll do well in those same events .
ALEX:  We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice .
BLAKE:  I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total .
ALEX:  You are very optimistic !
ALEX: Helen , did you hear I ’ m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place .
BLAKE:  I may have something on that day , but thanks for inviting me .
ALEX:  Well , drop by if you can .
BLAKE:  I will , do you want me to bring anything ?
ALEX:  No , just bring yourself . I hope to see you there .
ALEX: It's said that John's broken up .
BLAKE:  Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot .
ALEX:  I hear that John's leading a double wife .
BLAKE:  It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife .
ALEX: Let's play chess .
BLAKE:  I haven't played chess for a long time .
ALEX:  That's all right , I'm a beginner . I've just learnt how to play .
BLAKE:  Look , there's a chessboard . Those two men have already finished playing .
ALEX:  You're a very good player
BLAKE:  Not really , but once I won a prize .
ALEX:  So did I . I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners .
BLAKE:  My prize was for the best player in the country . Now let's start playing chess seriously .
ALEX: You have been here for how long ? Four months now ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , about .
ALEX:  Do you know Chinese better now ?
BLAKE:  Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone .
ALEX:  Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere .
BLAKE:  I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation .
ALEX:  A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it .
BLAKE:  I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time .
ALEX:  Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us .
BLAKE:  Yes , absolutely true .
ALEX: Excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ?
BLAKE:  Harry Potter .
ALEX:  Harry Potter ? Is that book funny ?
BLAKE:  Actually , the language itself is not so funny , but you can imagine the scene , that's funny .
ALEX:  Got it .
BLAKE:  Have you ever read this book before ?
ALEX:  No , but my little brother likes it very much .
BLAKE:  It's really a good book . You will like it too .
ALEX:  I'll try to read it . Actually , I like literature very much .
BLAKE:  Wow , that sounds like a scholar . By the way , who's your favorite writer ?
ALEX:  Jane Austen .
BLAKE:  Me too . Pride and Prejudice is my favorite .
ALEX:  I like it too . But Sense and Sensibility is my favorite .
ALEX: Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren .
BLAKE:  Thanks , Tim.Nice meeting you , too .
ALEX:  I guess we'll see just around .
BLAKE:  Ye , I hope so.well.Take it easy .
ALEX:  You too .
ALEX: Hey Sandra , what's wrong ? You look furious !
BLAKE:  I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit !
ALEX:  But Sandra ... you love your job ! You spent months trying to get this position . It's perfect for you !
BLAKE:  Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles !
ALEX:  What kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
BLAKE:  Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career !
ALEX:  So he talks about you behind your back ?
BLAKE:  Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back !
ALEX:  I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas .
BLAKE:  I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort .
ALEX:  My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . She liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday I was chatting with Tom . She meant Tom Solomon ... our CEO .
ALEX: Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !
BLAKE:  What is it ? What happened ?
ALEX:  I think someone is stalking me .
BLAKE:  No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?
ALEX:  I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .
BLAKE:  What did you do ?
ALEX:  I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .
BLAKE:  Did he leave when you left ?
ALEX:  Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .
BLAKE:  What did you do ?
ALEX: Man , I'm hungry . Do you know a good place to have lunch ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I know a great place . What types of food do you like ?
ALEX:  Mexican , Japanese or Chinese would be great .
BLAKE:  Oh , I know a place where you might like to eat .
ALEX:  Is it close by ?
BLAKE:  It's down a block on the right ; can I show you the way ?
ALEX:  OK , I'd love the company .
BLAKE:  This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it .
ALEX: have you ever been to Disneyworld ?
BLAKE:  when I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ?
ALEX:  the one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland .
BLAKE:  that's right . Why do you ask ?
ALEX:  well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon .
BLAKE:  when are you getting married ?
ALEX:  some time next year . We haven't set the date yet .
BLAKE:  congratulations ! I had no idea .
ALEX:  thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?
BLAKE:  do you like amusement parks ?
ALEX:  for the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though .
BLAKE:  if you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time .
ALEX:  even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?
BLAKE:  even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun .
ALEX:  thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight .
BLAKE:  I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it !
ALEX: Matthew ? Hi !
BLAKE:  Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ?
ALEX:  It's got to be almost a year now .
BLAKE:  How have you been ?
ALEX:  I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it .
BLAKE:  Yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ?
ALEX:  Not yet . But I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck .
BLAKE:  Well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ?
ALEX:  Mrs . Thou ?
BLAKE:  Yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look .
ALEX:  Great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days !
BLAKE:  I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ?
ALEX: Are you ready to go to the mall ?
BLAKE:  Yeah . Dig my new pants ?
ALEX:  Copycat !
BLAKE:  What do you mean ?
ALEX:  You went out and bought khakis , too !
BLAKE:  No . Mine are a soft brown . Yours are khaki .
ALEX:  Whatever .
ALEX: Have heard of Paul ?
BLAKE:  No , what ?
ALEX:  He's got a promotion .
BLAKE:  You're kidding .
ALEX:  No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
BLAKE:  I don't believe it.He is only being with the company for two years .
ALEX:  Well , it's true.The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul .
BLAKE:  Well.Good for him .
ALEX: Jeff , I'm going to the supermarket . Do you want to come with me ?
BLAKE:  I think the supermarket is closed now .
ALEX:  Oh , When does it close ?
BLAKE:  It closes at 7:00 on Sundays .
ALEX:  That's too bad .
BLAKE:  Don't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . It opens at 8: 00 .
ALEX:  Alright . What do you want to do now ?
BLAKE:  Let's take a walk for a half an hour . My sister will get here at about 8: 30PM and then we can all go out to dinner .
ALEX:  Where does she live ?
BLAKE:  She lives in San Francisco .
ALEX:  How long has she lived there ?
BLAKE:  I think she's lived there for about 10 years .
ALEX:  That's a long time . Where did she live before that ?
BLAKE:  San Diego .
ALEX: Hey , Peter , have you had lunch yet ?
BLAKE:  No . How about you ?
ALEX:  Not yet . Let's go to that restaurant on the corner .
ALEX: Who's that ?
BLAKE:  Search me .
ALEX: I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me .
BLAKE:  What did you argue about ?
ALEX:  He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet .
BLAKE:  Well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair .
ALEX:  Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry .
BLAKE:  Did you lend him a lot of money ?
ALEX:  Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back .
BLAKE:  Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ’ s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ?
ALEX:  No , we didn ’ t . I guess you ’ re right . We should patch things up .
BLAKE:  Of course you should . You wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ?
ALEX: Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy .
BLAKE:  I don ’ t think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking .
ALEX:  Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes will do no good .
BLAKE:  No , you can ’ t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres .
ALEX: Do you know that the dolphin is the most intelligent animal in the world ?
BLAKE:  Yes . Dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . They are also the fastest swimmers in the world .
ALEX:  They must be amazing animals .
BLAKE:  They are . I read a story about a dolphin saving a A from drowning in the sea .
ALEX:  I read that story too . They seem to be able to understand men .
BLAKE:  They sure can . Maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes .
ALEX: Oh dear , my weight has gone up again .
BLAKE:  I am not surprised , you eat too much .
ALEX:  And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help .
BLAKE:  No , I wouldn't think so .
ALEX:  I do wish I could lose weight .
BLAKE:  Well , why don't you go on the diet ?
ALEX:  I've tried diets before but they've never worked .
BLAKE:  Perhaps you should excercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class .
ALEX:  Yes , maybe I should .
ALEX: Could you please wait for a minute ? I'll buy the tickets
BLAKE:  All right .
ALEX:  Here is your ticket .
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX:  The park will close soon . We Should better go in right now .
BLAKE:  Really ?
ALEX:  Yes , let's go in .
BLAKE:  It is a new park , isn't it ?
ALEX:  Yes , how do you know ?
BLAKE:  I guessed it .
ALEX:  Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well .
BLAKE:  Oh , how wonderful !
ALEX: I was just watching a documentary on TV about how people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting .
BLAKE:  I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers .
ALEX:  The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow .
BLAKE:  Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation .
ALEX:  Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts .
BLAKE:  Can you ride a horse ?
ALEX:  Yes , I can . I don ’ t ride regularly though . How about you ?
BLAKE:  I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ?
ALEX:  What a good idea !
ALEX: Where's Mrs . Johnson ?
BLAKE:  Just call her Lisa , Mary . She's cooking dinner .
ALEX:  I see . Can I sit down ?
BLAKE:  Of course ! Make yourself at home .
ALEX:  Thank you , Mr . Johnson .
BLAKE:  Please , just call me Tom .
ALEX:  Okay , Tom .
BLAKE:  Where's Cindy ?
ALEX:  She's upstairs in my room .
BLAKE:  Can you tell her to come downstairs ? We're about to have dinner .
ALEX: Have you heard of Paul ?
BLAKE:  No , what ?
ALEX:  He's got a promotion .
BLAKE:  You're kidding .
ALEX:  No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
BLAKE:  Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years .
ALEX:  Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul .
BLAKE:  Well . Good for him .
ALEX: Let's speed up . We're going to be late again .
BLAKE:  If we hurry , can we get there in time ?
ALEX:  I hope so .
ALEX: Is it your first time to join the sports meeting of Junior High School ?
BLAKE:  Yes , and it's great . What are the events at the sports meeting ?
ALEX:  Long-distance race , dash , hurdle race , relay race , standing long jump , high jump , shotput and so on .
BLAKE:  Our neighbor , Bruce , will take part in the relay race . Let's go have a look .
ALEX:  OK , let's go .
BLAKE:  The competition will begin in 5 minutes , it's tense here .
ALEX:  Wonderful , Bruce is taking the lead .
BLAKE:  Other competitors have almost caught up with him . They are neck and neck .
ALEX:  Come on , Bruce . Come on , Bruce .
BLAKE:  Wow , Bruce crossed the line first .
ALEX: Tim ’ s smiles are interesting .
BLAKE:  Yes , they are shy and gentle but very powerful .
ALEX:  You are right . They sweep Nancy off her feet . And now she fell head over heels in love with him .
BLAKE:  How wonderful it would be if I had such smiles !
ALEX: Have you enjoyed your weekend ?
BLAKE:  Yes , it's been marvelous . It really was very kind of you to invite me . I hope it hasn't been too much trouble .
ALEX:  Not at all . We've really enjoyed having you . I hope you'll come and stay again next time you're in Changsha .
ALEX: The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors .
BLAKE:  It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it .
ALEX:  Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon .
BLAKE:  That's true .
ALEX: I ’ m forming a music band .
BLAKE:  Do you already know how to play an instrument ?
ALEX:  Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band .
BLAKE:  Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ?
ALEX:  We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass . Although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I ’ m a singer .
ALEX:  Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house .
BLAKE:  Great ! Wait here ? You don ’ t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ?
ALEX: What would you like for Christmas ?
BLAKE:  I would like to have that new style Gl Joe .
ALEX:  Have you asked Santa ?
BLAKE:  Yes and I've written him a letter .
ALEX: Lili , let ’ s take a vacation !
BLAKE:  George , how can we ? Vacations cost money . And this month we don ’ t have much money left after paying the rent .
ALEX:  Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ’ t cost much .
BLAKE:  Where will we sleep , then ?
ALEX:  In the van .
BLAKE:  What about other expenses ?
ALEX:  Let ’ s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ’ t spend much . Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ’ t we ?
BLAKE:  Maybe you ’ re right . When do you plan to go ?
ALEX:  The sooner the better ! I can ’ t wait !
BLAKE:  Oh , I don ’ t know where we ’ re going yet .
ALEX:  As long as we ’ re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time .
BLAKE:  Let ’ s go to Chicago.We can have lunch in Chinatown.Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field !
ALEX:  You have such good ideas !
ALEX: What date will our field trip be on ?
BLAKE:  The science field trip is next Monday at 8 o'clock in the morning . Do you want to make note of that on your calendar ?
ALEX:  Yes , I will make note of that .
BLAKE:  Next Monday is December 2nd . The buses will leave at 8 , but we must begin loading at 7
ALEX:  I will be there half an hour early .
BLAKE:  You might want to tell whoever is picking you up that you will return on December 8th . Do you have a ride ?
ALEX:  Yes , someone is picking me up .
BLAKE:  To get back to campus by 8
ALEX:  Not at the moment — maybe later , though .
BLAKE:  All of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway . See you on Monday !
ALEX: The acting of this film is marvelous in spite of the thin plot .
BLAKE:  I'm sorry for hero .
ALEX:  I don't think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts .
BLAKE:  Don't be too critical . We can't expect it to be perfect .
ALEX: How was your business trip ?
BLAKE:  Great - they wined and dined us all week .
ALEX: Nice to meet you here.How come you dropped into this company today ?
BLAKE:  My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office . I didn't know you were working here.What a surprise.How long have you been doing this ?
ALEX:  Two years or so .
BLAKE:  That is great.Do you have to work the night shift ?
ALEX:  No , in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . I work five days a week .
BLAKE:  Do you enjoy work here ?
ALEX:  It is hard to say.But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant.Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy .
BLAKE:  Take it easy . I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job .
ALEX:  Luckily not.The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss .
BLAKE:  Glad to hear that .
ALEX: Scientists have found a second solar system in the universe .
BLAKE:  What's the second solar system ?
ALEX:  It's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it .
BLAKE:  Is this good news or bad news ?
ALEX:  It's exciting news ! If we find a second solar system , we might find a second earth !
BLAKE:  You mean with people on it ?
ALEX:  Yes ! Isn't that exciting ?
ALEX: Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?
BLAKE:  Sorry , I thought you knew .
ALEX:  But you should tell me you were in love with her .
BLAKE:  Didn't I ?
ALEX:  You know you didn't .
BLAKE:  Well , I am telling you now .
ALEX:  Yes , but you might have told me before .
BLAKE:  I didn't think you would be interested .
ALEX:  You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?
BLAKE:  Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .
ALEX:  Oh , you men ! You are all the same .
ALEX: How was the movie last night ?
BLAKE:  I didn't really like it .
ALEX:  Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
BLAKE:  I found it very disappointing .
ALEX:  She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see .
BLAKE:  I wasn't happy with it .
ALEX:  Nothing is to your satisfaction .
ALEX: Honey , I ’ ll be right back !
BLAKE:  Where are you going ?
ALEX:  I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done .
BLAKE:  Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ?
ALEX:  Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me !
BLAKE:  Why ? I don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
ALEX:  They don ’ t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
BLAKE:  Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do .
ALEX: Good afternoon !
BLAKE:  Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ?
ALEX:  I'm very well , thank you.How are you ?
BLAKE:  Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ?
ALEX:  Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot .
BLAKE:  Yes .
ALEX:  What's the weather like in your country ?
BLAKE:  Mm ... It's quite warm now .
ALEX:  Where do you live ?
BLAKE:  In London.Where do you live ?
ALEX:  Here.Near this school .
ALEX: I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere !
BLAKE:  So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ?
ALEX:  That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself !
BLAKE:  Have you ever written up a business plan before ?
ALEX:  Well , no , it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ?
BLAKE:  You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc .
ALEX:  Well , that seems easy enough .
BLAKE:  Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea .
ALEX:  Geez . Is that all ?
BLAKE:  Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
ALEX:  Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
ALEX: I hear that Mary got mad .
BLAKE:  So I heard .
ALEX:  What ’ s wrong with her ?
BLAKE:  She went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident .
ALEX: Um , what will you do this weekend ?
BLAKE:  How about a movie ? We haven't done that for a while .
ALEX:  A movie ? Sure . Do you know what's on right now ?
BLAKE:  No . Why don't you check out the newspaper ?
ALEX:  Ok . Maybe you should invite your sister along , too .
ALEX: What ’ s on TV tonight ?
BLAKE:  Not much , that new reality-TV show , Ally McNeal , oooo , Dark Angel .
ALEX:  Wait a second . I want to watch Ally McNeal .
BLAKE:  Oh , come on . That ’ s such a girl ’ s show .
ALEX:  No it ’ s not . It ’ s just funny .
BLAKE:  Yeah , if you ’ re a girl .
ALEX:  Well , you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl .
BLAKE:  That ’ s not true . Dark Angel is a good show .
ALEX:  It ’ s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits .
BLAKE:  O . K . , O . K . Let ’ s forget it . There ’ s a football game on too .
ALEX:  No way . I ’ m watching Ally McNeal . Go to John ’ s to watch the game .
ALEX: It ’ s really terrible !
BLAKE:  What are you talking about ?
ALEX:  Don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all .
BLAKE:  You said it . Many parents just don ’ t know how to educate their children .
ALEX: Sarah , what did you do today ?
BLAKE:  I went shopping .
ALEX:  Did you buy anything ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I bought a few things .
ALEX:  What did you buy ?
BLAKE:  I bought this coat . Do you like it ?
ALEX:  Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ?
BLAKE:  At the mall on 5th street .
ALEX:  Was it expensive ?
BLAKE:  No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars .
ALEX:  That's cheap .
BLAKE:  I know . It was a really good deal .
ALEX:  I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately .
ALEX: Hi , Victor . How are you ?
BLAKE:  Oh , I'm fine .
ALEX:  So , are you going to go to class tonight ?
BLAKE:  Maybe ... but I don't think so .
ALEX:  Really ? What's the matter ?
BLAKE:  I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad .
ALEX:  Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner .
BLAKE:  Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already .
ALEX: How's John doing ?
BLAKE:  He can barely make ends meet .
ALEX: The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 .
BLAKE:  They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
ALEX:  If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final .
BLAKE:  No way , if it still has 21 .
ALEX: What's that book you have under your arm ?
BLAKE:  It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months .
ALEX:  How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn .
BLAKE:  I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day .
ALEX:  Is it really worth paying for ?
BLAKE:  I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter .
ALEX:  If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
ALEX: Come on , you are left behind !
BLAKE:  Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey .
ALEX:  You just need more exercise .
BLAKE:  Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing !
ALEX:  I don't care . I want to burn up my fat .
BLAKE:  But running so fast is not good for people over forties .
ALEX:  Why ?
BLAKE:  We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us .
ALEX:  But I want to burn up more calories !
BLAKE:  In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time .
ALEX:  Really ? I will slow down then .
ALEX: Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ?
BLAKE:  Fine , thank you . I haven ’ t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ?
ALEX:  I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films .
BLAKE:  Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary .
ALEX:  Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them .
BLAKE:  It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one .
ALEX:  But it's really exciting .
BLAKE:  Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one .
ALEX:  Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror .
BLAKE:  Yep .
ALEX:  I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind .
BLAKE:  Maybe . After all , I am grown up now .
ALEX: It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession .
BLAKE:  The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports .
ALEX:  Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost .
BLAKE:  It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy .
ALEX: Are you an art aficionado ?
BLAKE:  Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ?
ALEX:  I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art .
BLAKE:  I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school .
ALEX:  Art isn ’ t for everyone . I ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture .
BLAKE:  I like sculpture , especially that from ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ’ d love to go with you .
ALEX:  I thought I ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there .
BLAKE:  That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ?
ALEX:  Let ’ s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits .
ALEX: What does your mother do , may I ask ?
BLAKE:  My mother works in a company as an accountant .
ALEX:  Is she busy ?
BLAKE:  Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year .
ALEX: Hello , Bessie .
BLAKE:  Hello , Jack.Happy birthday !
ALEX:  My birthday ? I forgot it , Thank you for remembering my birthday .
BLAKE:  I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . I hope you'll like them .
ALEX:  Thanks a lot . I'm so touched .
BLAKE:  Now let me sing " Happy birthday " for you .
ALEX:  Thank you very much .
ALEX: Nice day , isn't it ?
BLAKE:  It sure is .
ALEX:  It's a good day for a picnic .
ALEX: Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ?
BLAKE:  I don't want to .
ALEX:  Well , come over and talk to me then .
BLAKE:  Certainly not .
ALEX:  May I turn on the TV then ?
BLAKE:  Turn on the TV for what ?
ALEX:  So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
BLAKE:  Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ?
ALEX:  I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner .
BLAKE:  To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it .
ALEX: Diane Grant ? I haven't seen you for ages !
BLAKE:  Brian ! How have you been ?
ALEX:  Pretty good . Say , you've really changed !
BLAKE:  Oh , well , I've lost some weight . And my hair is longer than before .
ALEX:  Well , you look great ! How are you ?
BLAKE:  I'm doing really well . I got married about three years ago . I have two kids now .
ALEX:  That's terrific !
ALEX: How is your new dormitory ?
BLAKE:  It's very nice . There are only four people , and those girls are very kind and friendly .
ALEX:  Well , do you all major in the same subject ?
BLAKE:  No , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating .
ALEX:  That's great !
ALEX: Peter , how often do you exercise ?
BLAKE:  Well , I swim and run every day .
ALEX:  Now , tell me , what do you eat ?
BLAKE:  Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .
ALEX:  Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
BLAKE:  Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
ALEX:  What do you drink ?
BLAKE:  Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
ALEX: What ’ s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ?
BLAKE:  We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River .
ALEX:  How hard is the climb ?
BLAKE:  It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
ALEX:  What did you do last week ?
BLAKE:  We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting .
ALEX:  Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it .
BLAKE:  Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb .
ALEX:  Yeah , I will . See you then !
BLAKE:  O . K . See you .
ALEX: How many languages can you speak ?
BLAKE:  I can speak French and German .
ALEX:  How well can you speak them ?
BLAKE:  I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well .
ALEX:  Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now ?
BLAKE:  No , but I'll be able to tomorrow .
ALEX: Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ?
BLAKE:  Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes .
ALEX:  It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture .
BLAKE:  You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler .
ALEX:  Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball !
BLAKE:  It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards .
ALEX: Do you really have to work today ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I'm afraid so .
ALEX:  But you'll miss out on the football game .
BLAKE:  Oh . Well , it can't be helped .
ALEX: How smart of you to book the tickets before hand !
BLAKE:  Oh , do you really think so ?
ALEX:  Of course , otherwise you ’ ll just have to wait for hours .
BLAKE:  But I just got a call from my sister and I have to cancel the movie tonight .
ALEX: I had an accident .
BLAKE:  That's terrible !
ALEX: I found a new job after all , and I like this one even better than the last .
BLAKE:  You see ? Every cloud has a silver lining .
ALEX: Tom , I won first prize in the poetry contest .
BLAKE:  Come on ! You're pulling my leg .
ALEX:  Really ! Here's my trophy .
BLAKE:  Wow ! Congratulations !
ALEX: What a beautiful watch . It goes very well with your ring .
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX:  Is that your wedding ring ?
BLAKE:  I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring .
ALEX:  Well , congratulations . When is the big date ?
BLAKE:  In June .
ALEX:  Did you have the watch before getting the ring ?
BLAKE:  Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch .
ALEX:  You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous .
BLAKE:  Thank you so much .
ALEX:  What kind of watch is it ?
BLAKE:  It's a Tag Heer .
ALEX:  If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ?
BLAKE:  This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .
ALEX:  That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for .
BLAKE:  Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .
ALEX: I'm really mad at Bob .
BLAKE:  What for ? ( Why ? )
ALEX: Hi , Jack , how have you been ?
BLAKE:  Not very well .
ALEX:  Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ?
BLAKE:  Nothing .
ALEX:  Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter .
BLAKE:  Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane .
ALEX:  Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher .
BLAKE:  Well , you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young .
ALEX:  Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family .
BLAKE:  Maybe you're right .
ALEX:  Jack , I don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match !
BLAKE:  Yeah , but it's hard to forget her at moment . You know , we were together for almost five years . It's really hard ...
ALEX: Do you know Sally ?
BLAKE:  Sally . She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains .
ALEX:  Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop clock .
BLAKE:  Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career .
ALEX: Excuse me . Do you have the time ?
BLAKE:  My watch is a few minutes fast . It's about six forty , I think .
ALEX:  Is it ? Oh , no . The concert will begin in twenty minutes . Are we too late to get there ?
BLAKE:  If we start now , we can make it by taxi .
ALEX: Did you watch the volleyball match last night ?
BLAKE:  Yeah .
ALEX:  Who won ?
BLAKE:  China .
ALEX:  What is the score ?
BLAKE:  China beat Brazil three to zero .
ALEX:  Wonderful .
ALEX: What do you mean ? If he was a good programmer , he should have been raking it in .
BLAKE:  The boss wanted to pay Bob with stock options . But Bob didn't want to play that game again .
ALEX:  Again ?
BLAKE:  At his last start-up , Bob worked for stock and no salary . They folded and he made zip .
ALEX:  Ouch .
BLAKE:  Now he only works freelance . Hundred bucks an hour .
ALEX: You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill .
BLAKE:  I'm sorry . I won't do it again .
ALEX:  Try to be more careful in future . Look ! you've damaged the sign .
BLAKE:  Is this the sign ? What does it says ?
ALEX:  It says No smoking here .
ALEX: Good morning . I ’ m from the New York book review . Could I ask you some questions about your latest book ?
BLAKE:  Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ?
ALEX:  First , I ’ Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story .
BLAKE:  That ’ s correct . It ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case .
ALEX:  How do you research your books ?
BLAKE:  I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people .
ALEX:  I really like your books . I ’ Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again !
BLAKE:  Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go .
ALEX:  Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ?
BLAKE:  There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your business card , I ’ ll make sure you get an advance copy to review .
ALEX:  Thanks very much . I ’ m sure it will sell well . I can ’ t wait to read it . Here ’ s my card . Thank you for you time .
ALEX: What shall I call him ?
BLAKE:  Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry .
ALEX:  What's he doing ?
BLAKE:  He's checking bags.He ' s an official in the customs .
ALEX: For the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party .
BLAKE:  That's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library !
ALEX:  I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas .
BLAKE:  That is right up my alley . You say party and I'm there .
ALEX:  Perfect . It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people .
BLAKE:  Will it be an all day event ?
ALEX:  Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library .
BLAKE:  That was quick thinking .
ALEX: I'm so glad I bought this watch !
BLAKE:  Cool ! Flashy red lines !
ALEX:  I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned .
BLAKE:  Is it waterproof ?
ALEX:  Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am .
BLAKE:  Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ?
ALEX:  Well , surfing , scuba diving ...
ALEX: Do you take a bus to and from work ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , everyday . And there ’ s only one choice . All the other buses are going the other direction .
ALEX:  Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ’ s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded .
BLAKE:  Oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt .
ALEX:  That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus .
BLAKE:  What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ?
ALEX:  You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding !
BLAKE:  Hmm . Good exercise , uh ?
ALEX:  Yeah , absolutely !
BLAKE:  And it ’ s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ’ s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her .
ALEX:  You were so happy , weren ’ t you ?
BLAKE:  What do you think ? I ’ m a good boy .
ALEX: We are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center .
BLAKE:  That's great .
ALEX:  Now let's get things ready .
BLAKE:  Don't worry . There are all kinds of things in the center .
ALEX:  That's much more convenient . We don't even have to bring the flavorings .
ALEX: Look ! Mom , that's amazing ! I can't believe the girls have so neat movements .
BLAKE:  Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice .
ALEX:  And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water .
BLAKE:  Exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together .
ALEX:  There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming .
BLAKE:  That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games .
ALEX:  Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you .
BLAKE:  My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you .
ALEX:  OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool .
BLAKE:  Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that .
ALEX: It seems that nobody in your class likes Paul .
BLAKE:  The boy is good for nothing .
ALEX:  As a teacher , I don ’ t know how to help him .
BLAKE:  He is hopeless .
ALEX: Hey Rachael , what's up ? How is your day ?
BLAKE:  Not bad.We have had a big meeting today , remember ?
ALEX:  Oh , yea . I forgot.So how did it go ?
BLAKE:  Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas .
ALEX:  Great , so what happens now ?
BLAKE:  Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it .
ALEX: Do you believe in UFOs ?
BLAKE:  Of course , they are out there .
ALEX:  But I never saw them .
BLAKE:  Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them .
ALEX:  You mean that you can them .
BLAKE:  That's right . I can see them in my dreams .
ALEX:  They come to the earth ?
BLAKE:  No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space .
ALEX:  Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ?
BLAKE:  OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings .
ALEX:  That means that you talk to them ? In which language ?
BLAKE:  Of course in English , they learn English on Mars too .
ALEX:  Wow . Sounds fantastic !
ALEX: You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest .
ALEX:  Really ? Congratulations !
BLAKE:  Thank you , Paul .
ALEX:  By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday .
BLAKE:  Good , happy birthday to you !
ALEX:  Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ?
BLAKE:  Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me .
ALEX:  My pleasure .
ALEX: Do you have a minute ?
BLAKE:  Sure . What's up ?
ALEX: Hey , May , look , Is that the the poster of the movie we saw yesterday ?
BLAKE:  Yes , that's right . That's the poster of the The Witch .
ALEX:  May , I really regret watching it with you last night .
BLAKE:  Did it scare you ?
ALEX:  Of course not . I just thought the movie was ... boring .
BLAKE:  Boring ? Come on , you clutched to my arm all the time .
ALEX:  Well , I admit . The ghosts were scary .
BLAKE:  I like scary movies .
ALEX:  That's Gucci's influence . I love science fiction movies !
BLAKE:  Of course you do . They are silly stories just for little kids like you .
ALEX:  Don't call me kid . I am a grownup .
BLAKE:  Do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight ?
ALEX:  Of course ! I can watch them without you !
BLAKE:  Oh , really ?
ALEX: What is your nationality ?
BLAKE:  I am Chinese by birth .
ALEX:  Where is your domicile place ?
BLAKE:  My domicile place is Hebes Province .
ALEX: I know you have a son . How old is he ?
BLAKE:  He's going to turn six next month .
ALEX:  Who is looking after him ?
BLAKE:  My mother-in - law . She retired last year .
ALEX:  You really are lucky !
BLAKE:  Yeah , I know .
ALEX: Say , what's your favorite sport ?
BLAKE:  Mmmm ... it's hard to say . I like golf a lot-but I guess I like tennis better .
ALEX:  Do you play much tennis ?
BLAKE:  Yes , quite a bit . How about a game sometime ?
ALEX:  Sorry . I'm strictly a spectator-football , baseball , basketball , golf ... I watch them all .
ALEX: So Janet , do you do any sports ?
BLAKE:  Well , I go to the gym a lot . I am a member of a gym nearby .
ALEX:  Yeah , how often do you go ?
BLAKE:  About three times a week if I can .
ALEX:  Not bad ! Do you do any other sports ?
BLAKE:  Not really . I ’ d really like to try golf , though .
ALEX: Hello , Ken .
BLAKE:  Hello , George .
ALEX:  Have you just been to the cinema ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I have .
ALEX:  What ’ s on ?
BLAKE:  Paris in the Spring .
ALEX:  Oh , I ’ Ve already seen it . I saw it on television last year . It ’ s an old film , but it ’ s very good .
BLAKE:  Paris is a beautiful city . I have never been there . Have you ever been there , Ken ?
ALEX:  Yes , I have . I was there in April .
BLAKE:  Paris in the spring , eh ?
ALEX:  It was spring , but the weather was awful . It rained all the time .
BLAKE:  Just like dear old London !
ALEX: They got a divorce at last .
BLAKE:  It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks .
ALEX:  You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks .
BLAKE:  That give us a good lesson .
ALEX: Where are you going ?
BLAKE:  I'll accompany my wife to the hospital .
ALEX:  What's wrong with her .
BLAKE:  She is expecting .
ALEX:  Congratulations to you .
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX: I can ’ t stand being with you anymore . I'm sick of your drinking .
BLAKE:  I swear never to drink again . Just give me another chance , please !
ALEX:  How many chances have I given you ? I don ’ t trust you any more .
BLAKE:  You know how hard I've tried to give up drinking ? I ’ d be lost without you . I won ’ t let you go anyway .
ALEX: Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ?
BLAKE:  There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia . It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers .
ALEX:  Was it caused accidentally or naturally ? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa .
BLAKE:  Nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . The drought in Africa is causing starvation . Millions of people have migrated to try and find food .
ALEX:  What is the international community doing to help ?
BLAKE:  The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies . Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies . Refugee camps have been set up across the region .
ALEX:  How many countries have been affected ?
BLAKE:  Six have been seriously affected , but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries .
ALEX:  I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in iran .
BLAKE:  Yes . There have been a few there recently . They say that this one was not a big quake . The Iranians are dealing with it on their own . They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried u
ALEX:  Does the newspaper say anything about casualties ?
BLAKE:  So far , less than 20 people have died , but over 100 are in hospital .
ALEX: Is this a photo of your family ?
BLAKE:  Yes , it is.It was taken just before I was leaving for college .
ALEX:  You look so lovely .
BLAKE:  How time flies ! I'll not see twenty again .
ALEX: I heard you've found a new job .
BLAKE:  Yes , I'm now working in a company .
ALEX:  So you're quite happy with your new job ?
BLAKE:  Right . I enjoy what I'm doing .
ALEX: Would you come to spend the weekend with us ?
BLAKE:  Oh , I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . I ’ Ve had a date already .
ALEX:  That ’ s too bad .
BLAKE:  May be some other time .
ALEX: You received a letter in the mail .
BLAKE:  Give it here .
ALEX:  Who ’ s the letter from ?
BLAKE:  I think it ’ s my acceptance letter from NYU .
ALEX:  I want to know what it says .
BLAKE:  They didn ’ t accept me .
ALEX:  Are you serious ?
BLAKE:  It ’ s the truth .
ALEX:  Are you okay ?
BLAKE:  I really wanted to get into NYU .
ALEX:  I am really sorry to hear that .
BLAKE:  It ’ s okay . I ’ m still waiting to hear from UCLA anyway .
ALEX: Why are you so quiet ?
BLAKE:  My girlfriend just broke up with me .
ALEX:  You must feel terrible now .
BLAKE:  Yeah .
ALEX:  I remember my first break up . It was the worst feeling in the world . I was crying everyday for three months . And slowly , it got better . I know you'll feel better too .
BLAKE:  You've been through this too ?
ALEX:  Yeah . I remember it very clearly . The pain makes it easy to remember . I know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups .
BLAKE:  But it hurts too much .
ALEX:  I know it's painful , but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away , you'll find other girls .
BLAKE:  What if I don't want to find another girl ?
ALEX:  You'll change your mind . Look at everyone in the world . They all break up and move on . The faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover .
BLAKE:  You're right .
ALEX:  I also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . You know she didn't treat you that well . Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
BLAKE:  Yeah . Thanks for the talk .
ALEX:  I'll give you a call later . We should hang out . It's good to be around people .
BLAKE:  Ok . I'll talk to you later .
ALEX: Excuse me , what do you want for this bag ?
BLAKE:  Let me see . The one goes for $ 17 .
ALEX:  Would you take $ 12 ?
BLAKE:  No , I can ’ t let you have it for 12.How about 14 ?
ALEX:  13.50 ?
BLAKE:  Sorry , $ 14 is the lowest I can go .
ALEX: I ’ m afraid I spoke in all of the table clock .
BLAKE:  Never mind about that .
ALEX:  I ’ m terribly sorry , Won ’ t you let me pay for ?
BLAKE:  No , I won ’ t hear of it .
ALEX: A :: Mr Clinton , it's nice to see you again .
BLAKE:  Nice to see you again , too . Peter . How's your family ?
ALEX:  A :: Very well . How's Mrs Clinton ?
BLAKE:  Not bad , But she's as busy as before .
ALEX: Whatever we do , we should do it above board .
BLAKE:  You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table .
ALEX:  Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels .
ALEX: Morning , Zina . Just wanted to say thanks again !
BLAKE:  Hi , Vince . Thanks for stopping by . How's the work coming along for the online auction ?
ALEX:  Oh , yeah . I'm glad you mentioned that . I think we need to hire somebody new to manage it .
BLAKE:  Can't Elvin handle it ?
ALEX:  I think he's got too much on his plate .
ALEX: This is the best dinner I've ever had .
BLAKE:  How about the soup ?
ALEX:  I've never tasted anything better .
BLAKE:  How nice of you to say so .
ALEX: Hey Nick , what are you up to ?
BLAKE:  Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ?
ALEX:  Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ’ t know man .
BLAKE:  Yeah , it will be fun ! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . I also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim .
ALEX:  Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower !
BLAKE:  Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ’ t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . For example , never handle a weapon that you haven ’ t inspected yourself . Always make sure there isn ’ t anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot !
ALEX:  Wow , I didn ’ t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
BLAKE:  The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ?
ALEX:  Let ’ s do it !
ALEX: Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven ’ t seen you for a while .
BLAKE:  I ’ m fine . I ’ Ve been out of town . I just got back .
ALEX:  Where were you ?
BLAKE:  I was in New York for a wedding .
ALEX: Broadway Mall is having a big sale this weekend . You wanna go ?
BLAKE:  Don't feel like it . I'm broke .
ALEX:  Well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ?
BLAKE:  Just look around ? Ah , that's boring .
ALEX:  I'll go myself then .
ALEX: What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps .
BLAKE:  I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated .
ALEX:  come on , nothing can be that bad .
BLAKE:  but promise me , you'll keep it a secret .
ALEX:  ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ?
BLAKE:  I've fallen in love with my boss .
ALEX:  really ? Is he married ?
BLAKE:  no , of course not . He is still single .
ALEX:  then what's your problem ?
BLAKE:  I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us .
ALEX:  oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip .
BLAKE:  worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days .
ALEX:  office romance is very tricky .
BLAKE:  it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed .
ALEX:  cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine .
ALEX: You're not looking happy . What's the matter ?
BLAKE:  Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired .
ALEX:  With the job ?
BLAKE:  With everything , with everybody , with all this !
ALEX:  A good suggestion for you . You need a holiday .
BLAKE:  It wasn't always like this , you know .
ALEX:  What do you mean ?
BLAKE:  Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives .
ALEX:  You need a holiday . That's what's the matter .
BLAKE:  Certainly , perhaps .
ALEX: I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there is .
BLAKE:  Hey , Isabelle ...
ALEX:  Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .
BLAKE:  Yes , I am the guy .
ALEX:  What a bummer ! You set me up ?
BLAKE:  Let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ...
ALEX:  How dare you ! ( starts to walk off )
BLAKE:  Hang on one second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella !
ALEX:  Why did you lie to me in the email ?
BLAKE:  I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name .
ALEX:  I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me .
BLAKE:  I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over .
ALEX: Peter , how often do you exercise ?
BLAKE:  Well , I swim and run every day .
ALEX:  Now , tell me , what do you eat ?
BLAKE:  Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .
ALEX:  Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
BLAKE:  Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
ALEX:  What do you drink ?
BLAKE:  Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
ALEX:  What do you drink ?
ALEX: Did you watch the volleyball match last night ?
BLAKE:  Yeah .
ALEX:  Who won ?
BLAKE:  China .
ALEX:  What was the score ?
BLAKE:  China beat Brazil 3 to 0 .
ALEX:  Wonderful !
ALEX: Even if our company didn't have a dress code , I still think people would wear formal clothing to work .
BLAKE:  I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in .
ALEX:  Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client .
BLAKE:  I think what you wear is so overrated . I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman .
ALEX:  It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale .
BLAKE:  Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day !
ALEX: Isn't it wonderful walking here ?
BLAKE:  What do you mean ?
ALEX:  I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
BLAKE:  Yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall .
ALEX:  It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ?
BLAKE:  You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering .
ALEX:  What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ?
BLAKE:  Quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark in the history of architecture .
ALEX:  What's there after that ?
BLAKE:  Well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world .
ALEX:  What are they all for ?
BLAKE:  Most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the world . And there are lots of very expensive places .
ALEX: Hey Kevin , what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ?
BLAKE:  I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them .
ALEX:  What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ?
BLAKE:  Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend .
ALEX:  And your parents took it badly ?
BLAKE:  That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her .
ALEX:  Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ?
BLAKE:  She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away .
ALEX:  How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ?
BLAKE:  Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage .
ALEX:  Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea .
BLAKE:  What do you mean ?
ALEX:  Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not .
BLAKE:  I guess so . Better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out .
ALEX: Do you think they two will get married ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , you can count on it .
ALEX:  I think so . Yes , they get along so well .
BLAKE:  I like him . He's good for her .
ALEX:  You're right . He sure is .
ALEX: What do you think of Frank ?
BLAKE:  He is all right . But I think he seems to have no back bone .
ALEX:  Why do you say that ?
BLAKE:  Whatever things get tough , he gives in .
ALEX: Uh-oh . We don't have a flashlight .
BLAKE:  Don't worry . We'll make it back to the camp site before dark .
ALEX:  I sure hope so .
ALEX: Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ?
BLAKE:  Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English .
ALEX:  I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ?
BLAKE:  Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said .
ALEX:  It must be interesting to study English .
BLAKE:  Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
ALEX:  Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ?
BLAKE:  Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
ALEX: It's quiet everywhere in winter .
BLAKE:  Yes . I like winter .
ALEX:  Me too .
BLAKE:  It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ?
ALEX:  That's a good idea . Let's go !
BLAKE:  What a heavy snow ! Look ! The water is frozen .
ALEX:  Take care ! Don't slip on the ground .
BLAKE:  I've got it . I like the feeling of stepping on the ice .
ALEX:  Yes . Very wonderful .
BLAKE:  There is a snowman over there .
ALEX:  How lovely it is !
ALEX: Tim's always bothering me .
BLAKE:  Just tell him off .
ALEX: Who are those guys ?
BLAKE:  Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O ’ Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ’ star players .
ALEX:  Oh .
BLAKE:  Wait a second . He shoots , he scores !
ALEX:  All right !
BLAKE:  Here comes Jordan , though .
ALEX:  Wow , Michael Jordan ’ s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch .
BLAKE:  Yeah . He ’ s older , so he doesn ’ t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ’ s still amazing .
ALEX:  Which team do you think will win ?
BLAKE:  The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has .
ALEX: I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr.Stone .
BLAKE:  It's ok . What do you want to ask ?
ALEX:  Where should I go after I arrived at the university ?
BLAKE:  The first place you should go is the International Center .
ALEX:  Why ?
BLAKE:  You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers .
ALEX:  What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ?
BLAKE:  They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you .
ALEX:  Can we get any more help at the International Center ?
BLAKE:  Yes , a lot more . If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student ID and social security number there . They will keep your documents up-to-date . They will offer an orientation program for new comers . They will also help you contact your department and registration office .
ALEX:  I see . It must be worth going to .
BLAKE:  Besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . In cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year .
ALEX:  Wonderful . It is a home for foreign students .
BLAKE:  It sure is . They also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful . Everyone loves them .
ALEX: hi , Lander . What's wrong ?
BLAKE:  I can hardly make ends meet these days .
ALEX:  same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months .
BLAKE:  my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .
ALEX:  true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .
BLAKE:  definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .
ALEX:  the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken .
BLAKE:  is that inflation ?
ALEX:  inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation .
BLAKE:  has the government taken some measures to curb it ?
ALEX:  yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .
BLAKE:  but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .
ALEX:  you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .
BLAKE:  how ?
ALEX:  for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense .
BLAKE:  sounds a good idea .
ALEX: OK , everyone . Gather around . Here are the rules . No tackling . No pushing .
BLAKE:  You shouldn't grab someone else's shirt . That's a foul .
ALEX:  Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched .
BLAKE:  You can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees .
ALEX:  The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play !
BLAKE:  Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men .
ALEX: Have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , almost . But there is one thing .
ALEX:  What ?
BLAKE:  I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ...
ALEX:  What is it ?
BLAKE:  Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others .
ALEX:  That makes you feel uncomfortable ?
BLAKE:  Yeah . we never do that in a public office .
ALEX:  Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy .
BLAKE:  I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding .
ALEX:  Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus .
BLAKE:  Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ?
ALEX:  Yeah .
BLAKE:  Oh , I'm shocked .
ALEX: What courses did you take in college ?
BLAKE:  I took a lot of courses , such as Philosophy , Logic , Ethics , Aesthetics , etc .
ALEX:  Which course did you like best ?
BLAKE:  I liked Aesthetics best . It is very impressive .
ALEX: Hi . Have you got a personal computer ?
BLAKE:  Certainly . What's the matter ?
ALEX:  I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet .
BLAKE:  Sure . I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores .
ALEX:  Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ?
BLAKE:  That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www.taobao.com or www . ebay.com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place .
ALEX:  Is the service charged ?
BLAKE:  No . it's free .
ALEX:  Really . I'll get a computer at once .
ALEX: We are planning to go to Beidaihe for vacation . Do you want to go with us ?
BLAKE:  It ’ s so cool !
ALEX: Excuse me , is this seat taken ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m afraid this seat is taken .
ALEX:  Oh . is it . Thank you anyway .
BLAKE:  You ’ re welcome . Why don ’ t you ask the conductor when he comes by ?
ALEX:  Thank you .
ALEX: I prefer potatoes to eggplants .
BLAKE:  I feel eggplants are more nutritious .
ALEX:  But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .
BLAKE:  Oh , that's how you see it .
ALEX: Are you sure you can't lend me five thousand dollars ?
BLAKE:  Hmm ... I'll tell you what . I'll lend you four thousand dollars , but you have to pay me back next week .
ALEX:  It's a deal .
ALEX: Where do you plan to go this winter ?
BLAKE:  Alps , suppose .
ALEX:  Oh , yes , you like skiing .
BLAKE:  Right .
ALEX: Every time when heroes came back from the battlefield , we took our hats off to them .
BLAKE:  You were showing respect and admiration for them .
ALEX:  I wish I were a hero .
ALEX: Frank ’ s getting married , do you believe this ?
BLAKE:  Is he really ?
ALEX:  Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much .
BLAKE:  Who is he marring ?
ALEX:  A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think .
BLAKE:  Have they set a date for the wedding ?
ALEX:  Not yet .
ALEX: OK . Come back into the classroom , class .
BLAKE:  Does the class start again , Mam ?
ALEX:  Yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough .
BLAKE:  Oh , breaktime flies .
ALEX:  Come on , baby . It ’ s time now .
BLAKE:  Mam , another minute , could I ?
ALEX:  Hurry up , little boy .
ALEX: Do you have any hobbies ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I like collecting things .
ALEX:  Oh , that ’ s interesting , and but what kind of things ?
BLAKE:  Several things , for example , Very coins , stamps , stones and so on .
ALEX:  Stones ? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?
BLAKE:  Yes , stones .
ALEX:  well , I can ’ t just imagine it .
ALEX: Jenny , what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ?
BLAKE:  Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night . I got to know the fact that you are playing the field .
ALEX:  Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth .
ALEX: What a nice day !
BLAKE:  yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ?
ALEX:  great , let's go !
BLAKE:  hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world .
ALEX:  exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ...
BLAKE:  yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies !
ALEX:  why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .
BLAKE:  are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ?
ALEX:  never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ?
BLAKE:  yeah , I think so .
ALEX:  ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great .
BLAKE:  wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases .
