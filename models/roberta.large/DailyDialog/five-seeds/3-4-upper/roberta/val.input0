ALEX:  You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . BLAKE:  What's special about these things ?
BLAKE:  What's special about these things ? ALEX:  Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic .

Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .
