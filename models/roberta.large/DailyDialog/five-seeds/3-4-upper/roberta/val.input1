BLAKE:  This is Mr Meng speaking , Michelle .
ALEX:  Oh , hello ! Sorry about that . I'm just calling to say that we've received your new Corporate Credit Card from HQ .
BLAKE:  That was quick ! I wasn't expecting it until later this week .
ALEX:  Yes , our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast-track system .
BLAKE:  Shall I come in and collect it ?
ALEX:  Or we can send it to you . But if you would like to use it at the ATM , you'll need to wait for your PIN number .
BLAKE:  Mmmm ... if I come in and collect it this afternoon , is there any way I could use it today ? Petty cash is getting low , so I need to draw some money .
ALEX:  As long as you bring your ID , etc , we can serve you over the counter . But you won't be able to use the ATM until your new PIN number arrives .
BLAKE:  I see . Yes , that's fine . I'll be there at around 2:30 pm . See you later , and thanks .

ALEX:  About ten days .
BLAKE:  Then how much is that by airmail ?
ALEX:  Let me see.It ' s 57 dollars , 20 cents , including tax .
BLAKE:  That's a little bit expensive .
ALEX:  Although it's expensive to send it by airmail , it's quicker and safer than by sea .
BLAKE:  I guess I have to send it by airmail .
ALEX:  Do you want to ensure the contents , Miss ?
BLAKE:  Yes , please .

BLAKE:  Yes , you are right .
ALEX:  Is it far ?
BLAKE:  No , It's only about five minutes ' walk .
ALEX:  Thank you very much .
BLAKE:  It's my pleasure .
ALEX: Could you give me some advice on how to bring up my son properly ?
BLAKE:  He's a bright boy , isn't he ?
ALEX:  But he always wimps out of difficulty .
BLAKE:  Don't worry , he'll make good progress step by step .
ALEX: I'm in 507 . I have a few problems with my room .
BLAKE:  What is that problem , sir ?

BLAKE:  Sir , we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel .
ALEX:  You dare to doubt me ?
BLAKE:  I'm sorry , sir . Let me transfer you to my supervisor .
ALEX: Excuse me , sir , I'm afraid you can't park your car here .
BLAKE:  Why not ? It's my parking space .
ALEX:  I'm afraid not , sir .
BLAKE:  Oh ? That's a surprise . Let me see ... D 0411 Our dog's birthday . Yes , I'm sure this my parking space !
ALEX:  But I saw a red car always parking here before .
BLAKE:  Oh , we've just repainted our car . It was red .
ALEX:  Maybe . But the car of this space has a broken rearview mirror on the left .
BLAKE:  Yeah . It used to . We got that fixed yesterday too .
ALEX:  Could you wait for a minute , sir ? I'd like to have a check .
BLAKE:  Sure , go ahead .
ALEX:  Sorry , sir , my mistake . This is your parking space .
BLAKE:  That's all right . It's not your fault .
ALEX: What can I do for you today ?
BLAKE:  I need to buy a new refrigerator today .
ALEX:  Were you looking at a particular refrigerator ?
BLAKE:  I like that Kenmore refrigerator .
ALEX:  This particular refrigerator is a very good choice .
BLAKE:  Tell me about it .
ALEX:  Not only is it affordable , but it comes with all the appliances .
BLAKE:  What are the appliances .
ALEX:  It has an ice maker , water dispenser , and plenty of room on the inside .
BLAKE:  I'd like to see it for myself .
ALEX:  Go right ahead .
BLAKE:  I like what I see .
ALEX: Oh , well . It was fun to be the winner . But ... it's too big . I must be an extra small in the States .
BLAKE:  So what about the tennis racket ?
ALEX:  Look ! It's amazing . I can't wait to try it out !
BLAKE:  How much did that end up costing you ?
ALEX:  Oh ... around twenty bucks . A bargain if you ask me . Look at the picture of her playing with it !
BLAKE:  Hey , two for one . That's a super deal .
ALEX:  And here's her signature !
ALEX: Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  I'm looking for someone who works here , but I lost his business card . His name's Long or Sang or something like that .
ALEX:  Chang ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , that sounds right .
ALEX:  There are about twenty people named Chang who work here . What department ?
BLAKE:  Let me think ... accounting , finance , something like that .
ALEX:  Eric Chang in accounting ?
BLAKE:  That's him !
ALEX:  I'll call him and tell him you're here .
BLAKE:  I appreciate your help .
ALEX:  Would you like to have a seat over there ? It'll just be a minute . And can I have your name ?
BLAKE:  Here's my card .
ALEX:  OK . I'll have him come up to get you .
ALEX: Hello , Sir . You're here to discuss the Network Settlement Service , right ?
BLAKE:  Yes , that's right . We want as much info as possible before we agree to anything .
ALEX:  Yes , it's important to be all clued up before you enter into any agreement . To make full use of the Network Settlement Service and take advantage of the whole banking system , we provide internal fund transfers , account inquiry , agency clearing to name but a few .
BLAKE:  So , do you think our corporation will be eligible for this ?
ALEX:  Yes , and it's extremely simple . All you need to do is make a Network Settlement Agreement with us .
ALEX: Dear , time is up , let ’ s go there now .
BLAKE:  Just a minute . I ’ m putting on my clothes .
ALEX:  Have you taken the key to the door ?
BLAKE:  Yes . Oh , dear , I can ’ t find my hairbrushes . Can you help me ?
ALEX:  Where have you put it ?
BLAKE:  I put it in the dressing room .
ALEX:  Are you sure ?
BLAKE:  Yes , quite sure .
ALEX:  Then , have you looked downstairs ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I ’ Ve looked everywhere downstairs .
ALEX:  Look , dear . It ’ s over there .
BLAKE:  Where ?
ALEX:  On the floor .
ALEX: Excuse me , sir . You can't park here .
BLAKE:  I am just waiting for my friends . It won't be long .
ALEX:  Sir , the curb here is not for parking .
BLAKE:  But I didn't see the sign , Ma ’ am .
ALEX:  There is a sign at the corner of the street . When you turned in here , you should have seen it .
BLAKE:  I didn't see it .
ALEX:  I am sorry , sir . I have to give you a ticket . You can appeal to the court within 14 days . You will avoid paying the fine if you can prove that you are not at fault .
ALEX: Are you a goal-oriented person ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I am . I always make a plan before I do anything .
ALEX:  Where do you want to be in 5 years ?
BLAKE:  I don't want to have a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing .
ALEX:  That sounds very reasonable .
BLAKE:  It's the most important thing to me .
ALEX:  If you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ?
BLAKE:  That obviously depends on how things go - - whether I'm suited to the firm and the firm to me .
ALEX:  Tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them .
BLAKE:  I want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . In order to achieve this goal , I just want to work step by step .
ALEX:  What is your long-range objective ?
BLAKE:  I haven't thought it over at all .
ALEX:  What do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ?
BLAKE:  I think the most important thing is the interest in the job .
ALEX: I'd like to open a current account .
BLAKE:  Certainly . May I see your social security and your ID , please .
ALEX:  Here you are . I wonder how much interest can I earn from a current account .
BLAKE:  Oh , current accounts don't pay out interest .
ALEX:  Why is that ?
BLAKE:  It's primarily designed for business transactions . That is , writing checks to pay for bills , buying things and sending money . We won't expect a large amount of deposit in a current account .
ALEX:  I see . How do I draw money for my own use then ?
ALEX: Good morning , Helen .
BLAKE:  Good morning , Steven .
ALEX:  So , what's the status of our advertising campaign ?
BLAKE:  It'll be a national campaign starting next week .
ALEX:  What style will the ads be ?
BLAKE:  I suggest that we focus on slice of life , showing how you can beat the summer heat by biting into a cool ice-cream sandwich .
ALEX:  Sounds like a good idea . Will we have a new slogan ?
BLAKE:  Definitely .
ALEX: I'd like to taste some local dishes . What would you recommend ?
BLAKE:  That's fine . You must try this dish .
ALEX:  Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ?
BLAKE:  It's fish steamed and served with our special sauce .
ALEX:  Is it good ?
BLAKE:  Sure . It's a most popular dish .
ALEX:  I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together .
BLAKE:  We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ?
ALEX:  What kind do you have ?
BLAKE:  We have French and Thousand Island .
ALEX:  Make it Thousand Island .
ALEX: Taxi !
BLAKE:  Where will you go , sir ?
ALEX:  Friendship Hotel .
BLAKE:  OK , it's not far from here .
ALEX:  I have something important to do , can you fast the speed ?
BLAKE:  Sure , I'll try my best . Here we are .
ALEX:  How much should I pay you ?
BLAKE:  The reading on the meter is 15 yuan .
ALEX:  Here's 20 yuan , keep the change .
BLAKE:  Thank you very much .
ALEX: Mr . Johnson ’ s office . Cindy speaking .
BLAKE:  Hi , Cindy . It ’ s Michael Kurt . Is Mr . Johnson in ?
ALEX:  No , I ’ m sorry , Mr . Kurt . He ’ s stepped out for a bit . Would you like me to have him call you ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , that ’ ll be great . I ’ m on extension 4283 .
ALEX: Hi , Mark .
BLAKE:  Hi , Bill . I ’ d like to take the apartment I looked at yesterday .
ALEX:  All right .
BLAKE:  So , what do we do now ?
ALEX:  This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords .
BLAKE:  Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ’ ll deposit one month ’ s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ’ s rent in advance . I understand that I ’ ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs .
ALEX:  Yes . If you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out .
BLAKE:  Can I pay you by check ?
ALEX:  Sure . A check will be fine .
BLAKE:  Is there a laundry room in the basement ?
ALEX:  Yes .
BLAKE:  Can I sign the lease right now ?
ALEX: Good morning ! What can I do for you ?
BLAKE:  I'm thinking of travelling to Suzhou in July . Could you recommend some tourist programs for that ?
ALEX:  With pleasure . We arrange two kinds of tourist programs for Suzhou , a six-day tour by train and a five-day flying journey .
BLAKE:  How much does a six-day tour by train cost ?
ALEX:  Five hundred yuan .
BLAKE:  Does that include hotels and meals ?
ALEX:  Oh , yes , and admission tickets for places of interest as well .
BLAKE:  That sounds reasonable . What about the five-day flying journey ? How much is that ?
ALEX:  Eight hundred and fifty yuan .
BLAKE:  Covering all expenses ?
ALEX:  Yes . But there is no half fare for children . They must pay full fare .
ALEX: I can't believe you wear jeans to the office ! Are you trying to lose your job ?
BLAKE:  Of course not . I'm just observing casual day . On Fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire .
ALEX:  Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ?
BLAKE:  We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes .
ALEX:  I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ?
BLAKE:  Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want .
ALEX:  It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity .
BLAKE:  Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days .
ALEX: ABC Company , my name is Lucy . How can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Hello , Lucy , this is Monica . I ’ m calling for the accountant position . I saw the information about the vacancy on your company ’ s website . Is it still available ?

ALEX:  It is urgent for us to fill this position now and I would like to stress that English is a must because of the international contacts and most likely traveling abroad very soon . If all these is not problem for you , I recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly .
BLAKE:  The notification period of my current job is not that long and I ’ m quite profession to English and I am happy with the traveling abroad as I ’ m good dealing with the people from other cultures . It makes the whole job even more interesting . I will send my resume to you still this week .
ALEX: Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes , do you have any rooms available ?
ALEX:  A single ?
BLAKE:  No . I need a double and three triples . My family is waiting for me in the car .
ALEX:  Please fill out this form , sir .
BLAKE:  Ok ... Here you are .
ALEX:  Here are your keys . Check out time is noon .
BLAKE:  Is breakfast included ?
ALEX:  No .
ALEX: Why didn't you go to school yesterday ?
BLAKE:  I stayed home because I wasn't feeling well .
ALEX:  What was your problem ?
BLAKE:  My stomach was bothering me .
ALEX:  Are you feeling any better ?
BLAKE:  I'm still feeling a little sick .
ALEX:  I'm going to the store , would you like any Pesto Pistol ?
BLAKE:  I'd appreciate that .
ALEX: Excuse me , but please empty your pockets of all the metal things and put them in this tray .
BLAKE:  Including my keys ?
ALEX:  Yes , and please step over there .
BLAKE:  All right . What shall I do now ?
ALEX:  Just open your bags so we can check them . After that you can pick them up right behind that X-ray machine .
BLAKE:  I've got film in my bag .
ALEX:  That's all right . This machine will not damage the film .
BLAKE:  That's fine .
ALEX:  Can I have your boarding pass ? We need to stamp it .
BLAKE:  Sure . Here you are .
ALEX:  Thank you .
BLAKE:  Am I through now ?
ALEX:  Yes . Here is your boarding pass .
BLAKE:  Thank you and goodbye .
ALEX: Welcome to Flash Foot , sir.How can I help you ?
BLAKE:  I ’ d like extra prints made of these photos .
ALEX:  Do you have your negatives ?
BLAKE:  Yes.Here they are . I ’ Ve marked how many prints I want on each shot .
ALEX:  What size do you want the prints ?
BLAKE:  Four by six , except this one . I want a ten by thirteen print of this one .
ALEX:  Okay , they ’ ll be ready for you in an hour .
ALEX: Is there anything I can do for you ?
BLAKE:  I'm interested in taking a tour to Sydney .
ALEX:  Well , we have a package tour there .
BLAKE:  How much does it cost ?
ALEX:  $ 600 .
BLAKE:  Does that include the insurance ?
ALEX:  Of course .
ALEX: Hello , Mr . Wang . I am glad to meet you here at the fair .
BLAKE:  Like wise . Take a seat , please . How about a cup of tea ?
ALEX:  Sure . Thank you . It seems your business is prosperous . There are many customers here .
BLAKE:  Yes , it's not too bad . Our sales are going up year after year . And we still have a large potential production capacity .
ALEX:  Well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ?
BLAKE:  That's a good idea . So far , we have several agents abroad .
ALEX:  We are willing to be your agent in Thailand for hand-held tools . What do you think ?
BLAKE:  That sounds good .
ALEX:  Then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ?
BLAKE:  Usually , we give a commission of 4 % to our agents .
ALEX:  4 % is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4 % is not enough .
BLAKE:  Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase .
ALEX:  You mean to saya
BLAKE:  It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ?
ALEX:  We may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment .
BLAKE:  All right . If it's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately .
ALEX:  Think it over . We hope to keep a good business relationship with you .
BLAKE:  Thank you for your help .
ALEX: I'm glad these batteries are on sale .
BLAKE:  I'm sorry . These batteries are not on sale .
ALEX:  But that's what the ad said .
BLAKE:  I'm sorry . If you look at the ad again , you'll see that the other brand is on sale .
ALEX:  Oh . You're right . I misread the ad .
BLAKE:  Yes , many people make that mistake .
ALEX:  Well , you can't blame them . It's a confusing ad .
BLAKE:  You're right . Many ads are like that .
ALEX:  Well , as long as I'm here .
BLAKE:  Just one second , and I'll give you the batteries that are on sale .
ALEX: Hi , Jack , we are having a party tonight , wanna coming enjoy us ? You can bring your girlfriend , Tina .
BLAKE:  I don't have a girlfriend . I'm single .
ALEX:  Oh , that's right . Well , there are going to be many beautiful girls at the party tonight , anyway .
BLAKE:  No , I like being single . I never thought lonely , I'm focus on my career . Maybe I'll start to look for my girl when I achieve success .
ALEX:  Why is that ?
BLAKE:  Because I'm living a real world , a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money . Franklin speaking the girls I've met wounldn't married a man wounldn't make enough money .
ALEX:  I agree , a man needs good career.But that doesn't mean he should have a little fun , too .
ALEX: So , Casey , how are things going with the photos for the press kit ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about that . I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline .
ALEX:  You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ?
BLAKE:  Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . .
ALEX:  I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time !
BLAKE:  I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures .
ALEX:  I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP !
ALEX: Yes , sir ?
BLAKE:  Can I have Mr . J . Smith paged ? He said he'd be in the main dining room . I'm Mr . J . B . White .
ALEX:  Who would you like to have paged again , sir ?
BLAKE:  Mr . J . Smith .
ALEX:  Where would you like him to come ?
BLAKE:  To the front desk .
ALEX:  Just a moment , please .
ALEX: Can you help me find a lotion for a problem I am having ?
BLAKE:  That ’ s what I am here for . What questions can I answer for you ?
ALEX:  I have poison oak , and I need help with the rash that won ’ t stop itching .
BLAKE:  The best product is Techne , and you can buy either the lotion or cream .
ALEX:  Which one is best ?
BLAKE:  The cream form is very popular .
ALEX:  Can I do anything else to help with the itching ?
BLAKE:  You could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker .
ALEX:  I appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching .
BLAKE:  Anytime you have a question , please feel free to ask .
ALEX: Excuse me . Something is wrong with my bank card . Can you help me ?
BLAKE:  Yes . What's the problem ?
ALEX:  Just a mistake with my name . It should be issued as Steven , but the card is under the name ' Steven ' .
BLAKE:  Oh , I am very sorry about that . It's our fault . I will arrange someone to correct it immediately .
ALEX:  OK , no problem . To err is human .
BLAKE:  Anyway , we apologize for the inconvenience we have brought you . Please just wait for a moment , and it will be fixed .
ALEX:  Thank you very much .
ALEX: We are doing Secret Santa at the office again this year .
BLAKE:  Whose name did you pick ?
ALEX:  I got Jacob . Any ideas what to get him ?
BLAKE:  Booze !
ALEX:  Yeah , you ’ re right . Can ’ t go wrong with that .
ALEX: Is everything to your satisfaction ?
BLAKE:  No , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh .
ALEX:  Oh , sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual . I will look into the matter .
BLAKE:  This is very annoying .
ALEX:  I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course .
BLAKE:  No , I don't risk it .
ALEX:  How about a delicious dessert then , with our compliment ?
BLAKE:  I'm not keen on dessert as a habit . They are fattening .
ALEX:  I see , sir . I'm sure everything will be right next time you come .
ALEX: Excuse me , are you Jane ?
BLAKE:  No , I'm Mary .
ALEX:  Oh , are you in Class Four ?
BLAKE:  No , I'm in Class There .
ALEX: Excuse me , but I'm not feeling too well . I think I'm going to throw up .
BLAKE:  There's an airsickness bag behind the seat that's in front of you .
ALEX:  I must've missed it .
BLAKE:  Is this your first time flying ?
ALEX:  Yes . I'm going to San Francisco .
BLAKE:  Oh , it's a beautiful city . I think you'll like it .
ALEX:  Hey , I'm feeling much better already .
BLAKE:  Sometimes if you don't think about it , that sick feeling will go away on its own .
ALEX:  Thanks . By the way , my name is Mary .
BLAKE:  I'm Frank . Nice to meet you .
ALEX: Welcome to Al's Bakery . What can I get you ?
BLAKE:  Hi ! Let me get a dozen croissants , four blueberry muffins and a loaf of sourdough bread .

ALEX:  We are out at the moment . May I suggest some rye bread ?
BLAKE:  Sure that sounds good . Do you have any cakes ?
ALEX:  We have various birthday cakes and also ice cream cakes .
BLAKE:  I'll just take a cheesecake .

BLAKE:  Yes .
ALEX:  Your total is forty three dollars and twenty cents .

I plan to say a few words about the current situation in the Middle East and how it affects world economy . I'd like to give you an overview of the way that the economies of seemingly unrelated countries are intertwined .

BLAKE:  Ah , hello . I'm calling to find out how I apply for a car loan .
ALEX:  We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . The application process is pretty straight forward . I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account .
ALEX:  The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ...
BLAKE:  Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want .
ALEX:  That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ?
BLAKE:  Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB .
ALEX:  What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment .
BLAKE:  Yes , I have everything here . OK , I'll come in and see you later today . Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week ! How exciting !
ALEX: Hi , my name is Tom .
BLAKE:  Tom , the new sales representative ? Nice to meet you ! I'm Melinda .
ALEX:  Nice to meet you too.Melinda .
BLAKE:  Now let me show you around . This is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . Over here is the sales department .
ALEX:  Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small .
BLAKE:  Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there .
ALEX:  It looks like you guys work hard .
BLAKE:  I tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.Just kidding . Oh , your cubicle is over the . And this way . Those are all private offices the managers offices .
ALEX:  Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs .
BLAKE:  Sure thing .
ALEX: What do you think of our price ?
BLAKE:  Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ?
ALEX:  Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly .
BLAKE:  I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable .
ALEX:  I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .
BLAKE:  I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % .
ALEX:  I ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
BLAKE:  Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ?
ALEX:  We've already cut down our price to cost level .
BLAKE:  Is that all ?
ALEX:  Yes , this is the best we can do .
BLAKE:  I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered .
ALEX: So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ?
BLAKE:  It ’ s great , dad . I don ’ t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money .
ALEX:  Even though you are only twelve , it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money .
BLAKE:  I ’ Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ’ t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ?
ALEX:  You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest .
BLAKE:  But what if I need my money suddenly ?
ALEX:  The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM .
BLAKE:  Great ! So it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters !
ALEX:  Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don ’ t have to worry about that yet . Let ’ s go make your first depot
BLAKE:  OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal .
ALEX: Is this where I can catch a bus to the theater ?
BLAKE:  Yes , but you can't get there with out a change .
ALEX:  Which bus do I have to change ?
BLAKE:  You have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 .
ALEX:  I see . Thank you .
ALEX: Here we are , Joan . This is the Palace museum , also known as the Forbidden city .
BLAKE:  Oh , how splendid ! Can you take a picture of me here ?
ALEX:  Sure .
ALEX: Excuse me . I'm afraid I got lost . Where am I on this map ?
BLAKE:  We are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city .
ALEX:  Oh ! Can I go from here to the Zhongshan Park ?
BLAKE:  Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right .
ALEX: Tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ?
BLAKE:  Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month .
ALEX:  Is there anything else ? How about my salary ?
BLAKE:  Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record .
ALEX:  Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ?
BLAKE:  All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days .
ALEX:  Okay , that's good . I get it .
ALEX: Kate , you never believe what's happened .
BLAKE:  What do you mean ?
ALEX:  Masha and Hero are getting divorced .
BLAKE:  You are kidding . What happened ?
ALEX:  Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce .
BLAKE:  That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ?
ALEX:  Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out .
BLAKE:  That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ?
ALEX:  Early in the New Year I guess .
ALEX: Overseas operator .
BLAKE:  I would like to make a collect call to Taipei , Taiwan , please .
ALEX:  Your name , please .
BLAKE:  Tim Chen .
ALEX:  What's the number , please .
BLAKE:  The area code is 2 , and the number is 2367-9960 .
ALEX:  The line is connected . Please go ahead .
ALEX: Hello . Excuse me .
BLAKE:  Yes . Can I help you ?
ALEX:  Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago .
BLAKE:  Of course I remember you .
ALEX:  I think I lost my wallet here .
BLAKE:  Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything .
ALEX:  Really ? You didn't find a wallet ?
BLAKE:  No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ?
ALEX:  Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ?
BLAKE:  No . It's been empty the whole time .
ALEX:  Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened .
BLAKE:  I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ?
ALEX:  No . My friend did .
BLAKE:  Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ?
ALEX:  No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table .
BLAKE:  Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home .
ALEX:  I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ?
BLAKE:  Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that .
ALEX:  Should I call the police ?
BLAKE:  You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets .
ALEX:  Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home .
BLAKE:  I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir .
ALEX:  Thanks for your help .
ALEX: Good morning , young lady . You can call me Ma . Do you see anything you like ?
BLAKE:  Yes . Many things ! I especially love this beautiful quilt .
ALEX:  That quilt was passed down to me from my ma in Holland .
BLAKE:  It sounds like a special quilt . Why do you want to sell it ?
ALEX:  Well , this home is too big for me now , so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . Therefore , I need to part with a few things .
BLAKE:  Oh , I see . Umm , how much do you want for the quilt ?
ALEX:  Is fifteen dollars OK ?
ALEX: Have you got change for a thousand ?
BLAKE:  Let me see .
ALEX: May I come in , Mr Sun ?
BLAKE:  I ’ d rather you didn ’ t , Miss Yang . I ’ m very busy now .
ALEX:  Can I try later then ?
BLAKE:  Yes , of course .
ALEX:  Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ?
BLAKE:  Well , uh ... I ’ m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ?
ALEX:  Do you mind if I sit down ?
BLAKE:  Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ?
ALEX:  I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ?
BLAKE:  Yes . But why should you want to do that ?
ALEX:  Do you mind if I speak frankly ?
BLAKE:  Not at all . Go ahead .
ALEX:  Well . You see , I don ’ t like the office . I don ’ t like the staff . And I ’ m afraid of you . And I don ’ t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I ’ d be delighted if you did .
ALEX: Where is that ?
BLAKE:  Take me to the airport , please .
ALEX:  Are you in a hurry ?
BLAKE:  I have to be there before 17 o'clock .
ALEX:  We'll make it except a jam . You know it's rush hour .
BLAKE:  There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
ALEX:  I'll do my best .
BLAKE:  Here's twenty dollars .
ALEX:  Do you have small bills ?
BLAKE:  No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ?
ALEX:  Here is your receipt . Thank you .
ALEX: Recently I have been getting headache and my eyes don't seems to see focus properly .
BLAKE:  When did you last time have your eyes checked ?
ALEX:  Two years ago . At that time I had no problems.Now I can ’ t even make out something ten meters away .
BLAKE:  Come over here . I will test your eyes . First cover your left eye like this , and when I point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can , telling me which way the “ E ” points .
ALEX:  All right .
BLAKE:  Good.Now the other eye .
ALEX:  Well , this one is worse .
BLAKE:  Never mind , just read as far as you can .
ALEX:  I can only read the first three lines .
ALEX: Is there a car park near the supermarket ?
BLAKE:  Yes , there is an underground car park near the supermarket .
ALEX:  I see . Thanks .
ALEX: Oh , come on , Ultraman !
BLAKE:  What's up , Bro ? What's in the bulletin ?
ALEX:  It says that there will be a blackout from 5 p . m . to 7 p . m . in our neighborhood today .
BLAKE:  Blackout ? Even the TV has the limit .
ALEX:  Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?
BLAKE:  Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either !
ALEX:  That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ?
BLAKE:  Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner !
ALEX:  OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here .
BLAKE:  How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ?
ALEX:  Barbie ? You know , I might be seven , but I'm not a girl .
BLAKE:  Do you have a better plan ?
ALEX:  All right , all right .
ALEX: Yes , ma'am , how could I help you ?
BLAKE:  I am wondering if you do facial care ?
ALEX:  Yes , we do .
BLAKE:  How much would it be ?
ALEX:  From 200 to 800 .
BLAKE:  I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ?
ALEX:  No problem .
ALEX: Can I help you , Miss ?
BLAKE:  I would like to order 2 office-style cabinets and desk calendars . We want office-style cabinets in white . The catalogue number is 90 - f - 2356 .
ALEX:  How soon do you want it ?
BLAKE:  Could you deliver it tomorrow ?
ALEX:  No problem .
BLAKE:  Please handle the items carefully .
ALEX:  Certainly .
BLAKE:  We will pay by collect on delivery .
ALEX: I hate to do this to you , Alice , but I ’ m going to have to ask you to put in some more overtime .
BLAKE:  Does it have to be this afternoon , Mr . Fairbanks ? I ’ Ve already made plans .
ALEX:  Well , I would have preferred to do it today , but if you ’ Ve already made plans , we can do it tomorrow .
BLAKE:  I ’ d appreciate that , sir . How long do you think you ’ ll need me to stay ?
ALEX: What ’ s your attitude when do wrong things at work ?
BLAKE:  The buck stops here .
ALEX: Hello ! Is your company advertising for administrative assistant on the newspapers ?
BLAKE:  Well , Administrative assistant with shorthand and typing skills are badly needed here .
ALEX:  First I want to check about the availability and see if you could give me more information .
BLAKE:  The position calls for a person with some working experience . We must be able to benefit from your analytical and interpersonal skills . Can you deliver your resume to us first ?
ALEX:  Of course . I will deliver my resume to you in minutes ' time . I hope you will consider my application and I shall appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience .
BLAKE:  OK . I will call you soon . Bye now .
ALEX:  Bye .
ALEX: Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview .
BLAKE:  It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time .
ALEX:  You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview .
BLAKE:  The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . And the length depends on the particular situation .
ALEX:  Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation .
BLAKE:  To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression .
ALEX:  Selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief .
BLAKE:  It should also be truthful and realistic . Do not blindly blow your own horn .
ALEX:  You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for .
BLAKE:  While you should not omit your weak points , they need to be described appropriately
ALEX:  Time permitted , you could add certain examples to your description .
BLAKE:  Besides , in the interview , it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly .
ALEX: Hello ?
BLAKE:  Hi , Deborah ! This is John . I'm calling from Australia .
ALEX:  What are you doing in Australia ?
BLAKE:  I'm attending a conference in Sydney this week . Remember ?
ALEX:  Oh , right . What time is it there ?
BLAKE:  It's 10:00 P . M . And it's four o'clock in Los Angeles , right ?
ALEX:  Yes - four o'clock in the morning .
BLAKE:  4:00 A . M . ? I'm really sorry .
ALEX:  That's OK . I'm awake now .
ALEX: John hasn't turned up and Stefan is ill . Do we have anyone on stand-by ?
BLAKE:  I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement .
ALEX: Jack , let ’ s go !
BLAKE:  Oh , you are out of breath ! What happened ?
ALEX:  Some people are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave here as soon as possible !
BLAKE:  Take it easy . They will get caught .
ALEX: Hello . May I speak to Jerry , please ?
BLAKE:  Sorry , but he is out for lunch right now .
ALEX:  I see . Can you give me some idea how long he'll be back ?
BLAKE:  I think he will be back around 2:00 . If you like , please leave your name and phone number , I'll have him call you as soon as he comes back .
ALEX:  That's nice . My name is Steven , my phone number is 6789777 . Okay , I'll be waiting for his call . Thank you and bye !
BLAKE:  My pleasure , bye !
ALEX: Excuse me , Miss .
BLAKE:  What can I do for you ?
ALEX:  I've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed .
BLAKE:  What's your flight number ?
ALEX:  Flight CA216 to Chengdu .
BLAKE:  Yes , it's true . It has been delayed .
ALEX:  Could you please tell me why ?
BLAKE:  Yes , of course . The delay is due to heavy rain .
ALEX:  How long will the delay be ? Do you have any further information about it ?
BLAKE:  I am sorry , we don't know the extent of the delay at present . But according to the latest weather forecast , there will be a change in weather soon .
ALEX:  We have to wait . Well , is it possible for the rain to stop before noon ?
BLAKE:  It's hard to say . Weather is so changeable in the summer . Please listen to the latest announcement about your flight .
ALEX:  Yes , I will . Thanks a lot . Bye !
BLAKE:  Bye
ALEX: What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !
BLAKE:  I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .
ALEX:  I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !
BLAKE:  I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ?
ALEX:  I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .
BLAKE:  Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?
ALEX:  I don't know .
BLAKE:  I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .
ALEX:  What do you mean ?
BLAKE:  We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .
ALEX:  I have plenty of gas .
BLAKE:  Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .
ALEX:  So what can we do ?
BLAKE:  Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible .
ALEX:  Alright . That's a good idea .
BLAKE:  I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .
ALEX:  Days ?
BLAKE:  Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .
ALEX:  Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .
BLAKE:  Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .
ALEX: Hey , buddy , can ’ t you see there ’ s a line ?
BLAKE:  Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t know .
ALEX:  What ? You haven ’ t taken the bus before ?
BLAKE:  No , I ’ m afraid not .
ALEX:  Well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . Besides , you should let old people on first .
BLAKE:  Sorry .
ALEX:  It ’ s all right . Where are you going ?
BLAKE:  I wanted to see the White House .
ALEX:  Oh , well you don ’ t want this bus , anyway . It goes to Georgetown .
BLAKE:  Oh , no .
ALEX:  It ’ s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A .
BLAKE:  Oh , well thank you very much .
ALEX:  You ’ re welcome .
ALEX: Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  I'd like the double cheese burger meal , please .
ALEX:  What kind of drink would you like with that ?
BLAKE:  Just coke will be fine .
ALEX:  Would you like a super size meal ? Only 2 RIB more , you'll get large coke and fries instead of medium . And today we are offering free toys all the meal boxes .
BLAKE:  That sounds good , thanks , I'd like that . Actually I'd like sprite instead of coke , thanks .
ALEX:  That's not a problem , Miss . Will that be it ?
BLAKE:  Yes , that's all .
ALEX:  That will be 25RMB , please
BLAKE:  You got it .
ALEX: Do you have any night tours ?
BLAKE:  Yes , we will depart in 10 minutes .
ALEX:  Is that a guided tour ?
BLAKE:  Yes , it is .
ALEX:  That's fine . Let's get on the bus .
ALEX: I am sure we will make it up as soon as possible .
BLAKE:  That's nice .
ALEX:  We hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings .
BLAKE:  Of course not . We have cooperated for a long time .
ALEX: I would like to purchase some meat .
BLAKE:  What kind of meat would you like to get today ?
ALEX:  First off , I'm going to need a pound of ground beef .
BLAKE:  A pound of ground beef is $ 2.48 .
ALEX:  That's perfect .
BLAKE:  What else will you be needing ?
ALEX:  I'm also going to need three pounds of chicken breasts .
BLAKE:  The chicken breasts cost $ 4.05 per pound .
ALEX:  What's the total price for the chicken ?
BLAKE:  It's going to be $ 12.15 .
ALEX:  Okay , I think that will be all for me today .
ALEX: I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks .
BLAKE:  Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us .
ALEX:  Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market .
BLAKE:  Do you sell direct to shops ?
ALEX:  Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen .
BLAKE:  Do you keep a stock of these things ?
ALEX:  In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course .
BLAKE:  That is , your commission .
ALEX:  Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal .
BLAKE:  Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission .
ALEX:  The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much .
BLAKE:  According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ?
ALEX:  We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with .
BLAKE:  We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ...
ALEX:  Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ?
BLAKE:  Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect .
ALEX:  Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products .
BLAKE:  Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details .
ALEX:  Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ?
BLAKE:  Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction .
ALEX:  All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency .
BLAKE:  Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair .
ALEX: Excuse me , I ’ m sorry to trouble you . My name is Susan Ransom , and I have placed several orders with you company .
BLAKE:  Yes , Mr . Ransom ? This is Karl Miller . How may I help you ?
ALEX:  Well , I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month . It hasn ’ t arrived yet .
BLAKE:  Certainly , Ms . Ransom . Do you have an order number ?
ALEX: Have you worked out the offers . Mr . Thou ?
BLAKE:  Yes , we have . Here's our CIF quotation sheet . Please have a careful look .
ALEX:  Are the prices on the list firm offers ?
BLAKE:  Yes . All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation .
ALEX:  I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices .
BLAKE:  All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ?
ALEX:  How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan .
BLAKE:  I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days .
ALEX: Hello sir , may I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
ALEX:  I see . Well , you have come to the right place . We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers .
BLAKE:  Sounds good . I don ’ t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range .
ALEX:  We have this new ETC smart phone.It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications . It also has a built-in camera , mp3 player and touch screen . It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are .
BLAKE:  What about Wi-fi ?
ALEX:  Of course ! You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home .
BLAKE:  One last thing . Is it waterproof ?
ALEX: We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet !
BLAKE:  Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
ALEX:  Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
BLAKE:  I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard !
ALEX:  What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .
BLAKE:  Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ?
ALEX:  We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
BLAKE:  Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !
ALEX:  I ’ ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there .
BLAKE:  Yay !
ALEX: Good evening , Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ?
BLAKE:  Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ’ t understand .
ALEX:  From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ’ s overbooked .
BLAKE:  I know what overbooked is , I just don ’ t understand how that could happen ?
ALEX:  Actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats ,
BLAKE:  So who has to stay behind ?
ALEX:  Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone .
BLAKE:  Ok . I ’ ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket !
ALEX: I want to rent this apartment .
BLAKE:  I ’ m glad to hear that .
ALEX:  How much are you asking ?
BLAKE:  You will have to pay $ 1050 every month .
ALEX:  I can ’ t afford that .
BLAKE:  What can you afford ?
ALEX:  I was thinking $ 800 a month .

ALEX:  Oh , really ? are there any snakes ?
BLAKE:  snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .
ALEX:  that's terrific . I can't wait to check it out .
BLAKE:  Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?
ALEX:  why not ? it's so cool .
BLAKE:  but it will pose a risk to your health .
ALEX:  pardon ?
BLAKE:  i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems .
ALEX:  well , I didn't realize that .
BLAKE:  I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .
ALEX:  oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .
BLAKE:  yes , good luck , Maria .
ALEX: I ’ m a new student . My name ’ s Robert .

BLAKE:  I see . You are in luck this month because all of our models are on sale ! it is a perfect time to buy a new car since it ’ s the end of the year .
ALEX:  Perfect ! I like this one .
BLAKE:  That is the Ford Focus . A very light but powerful vehicle . It comes with dual side airbags , power steering and power windows , tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission .
ALEX:  Sounds like a good car ! How many miles to the gallon ?
BLAKE:  It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway .
ALEX:  That is really convenient . Especially now that fuel prices are so high ! What ’ s under the hood ?
BLAKE:  A very powerful 2.5- liter turbocharged engine , Trust me , this car is fast !
ALEX:  Now for the most difficult question . What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
BLAKE:  Very affordable mam . You can take it out of this lot today with 0 % down payment and no interest for the first year ! You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .
ALEX:  Great ! Let ’ s do it !
ALEX: I wonder if you could help me , I'm looking for a room .
BLAKE:  Well , I have got a vacancy .
ALEX:  What sort of price are you asking ?
BLAKE:  Eight dolls fifty a week excluding laundry .
ALEX:  Would it be convenient to see the room ?
BLAKE:  Can you call back later ? We're right in the middle of lunch .
ALEX: Could you give me an expense report ? I would like to attach the invoices for my phone bill this season .
BLAKE:  Here you are . Do you need glue ?
ALEX:  That is very kind of you . I ’ m just running out of glue .
BLAKE:  You ’ re welcome .
ALEX: IBA , Jane speaking . How can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Hello . I'd like to speak to someone regarding my card .
ALEX:  Sorry , I'm not quite sure if I understand . In what way , Sir ? Has your card been stolen ?
BLAKE:  No , no . Nothing at all like that . It's just that I applied for a credit card with you a while ago , my application was accepted , but I'm still waiting for my card .
ALEX:  Oh , I see , Sir . Well , it does take 5 working days to issue and post the card .
BLAKE:  Yes , my application was accepted last Friday . Now it's Wednesday , that's more than 5 days .
ALEX:  Sorry , Sir , but it's 5 working days . This does not include weekends , so your card should be with you later this week .

BLAKE:  About seven thirty.By the way , could you also bring me tomorrow's papers ?

BLAKE:  You should do one of the two things - either to lodge a claim with the shipowner or with the insurance company .
ALEX:  Shall we leave it to the brokers ?
BLAKE:  Yes . They usually do it .
ALEX:  Do they charge for that ?
BLAKE:  Of course . In Europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service .
ALEX:  Is it the same in America ?
BLAKE:  They do the work without charge to the importer .
ALEX:  It's part of their service , isn't it ?
BLAKE:  Exactly .
ALEX:  Is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ?
BLAKE:  No , you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment .

BLAKE:  Yeah me too . Oh ! Can we stop at the shop really fast ? I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things .
ALEX:  Will you take long ?
BLAKE:  No ! Five minutes I promise !
ALEX:  Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish !
BLAKE:  Are you crazy ? You have no idea what you are talking about ! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . Then I need to get foundation , liquid foundation .
ALEX:  Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon !
BLAKE:  What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ...
ALEX:  Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon !
ALEX: Can I borrow five bucks ?
BLAKE:  No !
ALEX:  Come on ! I'll pay you back on Tuesday .
BLAKE:  Last time I lent you money , you never paid me back .
ALEX:  I promise if you lend me five dollars today , I will repay you in full next week .
BLAKE:  Ok , but I'm taking your skateboard as collateral .
ALEX:  Fine ! I can't believe you don't trust me .
BLAKE:  It's nothing personal , just business .

BLAKE:  Yes , please . I'm looking for a cotton polo shirt .
ALEX:  Any particular colour ?
BLAKE:  Not really .
ALEX:  How about this one ?

ALEX: Are you going home now ?
BLAKE:  No , I'm not .
ALEX:  What are you going to do ? Are you going to work late ?
BLAKE:  No , I'm not . I'm going to look for an apartment .
ALEX:  An apartment ? Why ?
BLAKE:  I'm going to try to find a place near the office .
ALEX:  Where are you living now ?
BLAKE:  Out in the suburbs . It's a long trip to work every day .
ALEX:  How are you going to find an apartment ?
BLAKE:  I'm going to buy a newspaper and check the classified ads .
ALEX:  Apartments in the city are expensive .
BLAKE:  I know , but I'm going to enroll in a night school to take a course in business management .
ALEX: no , no , you helped me with my computer last week . I want to repay the favor .
BLAKE:  no , it's definitely my turn to treat you ... you paid last time !
ALEX:  oh , that was just a quick bite to eat---that doesn't count !
BLAKE:  ok , ok , how about we just go Dutch ? It's settled . Listen , I'm still pretty new around here , would it be alright if you found the restaurant ?
ALEX:  ok ... sure .
ALEX: I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there ’ s something wrong with the fax machine .
BLAKE:  What ’ s wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ?
ALEX:  Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ?
BLAKE:  Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out .
ALEX: Hey , Jim . It's time to wake up and get out of bed .
BLAKE:  Do I have to get up now ?
ALEX:  You'd better get up , or you'll be late .
BLAKE:  What're you talking about ? My alarm even hasn't gone off yet .
ALEX:  Yes , it did . It went off thirty minutes ago . You slept right through it . You're like a dead person while you sleep .
BLAKE:  I must have slept right through it .
ALEX:  Rise and shine ! Sleepyhead !
BLAKE:  Just let me sleep five more minutes .
ALEX:  The early bird gets the worm .
BLAKE:  I know , I know . But I don't want any worms .
ALEX:  Ha ! Ha ! If you don't make an effort now , later on it'll be a lot tougher for you .
ALEX: What shall we do tonight ?
BLAKE:  How about the cinema ?
ALEX:  That's a good idea . We haven't seen a film for ages . What would you like to see ?
BLAKE:  Oh I don't know . Titanic ?
ALEX:  Titanic ? That old film ? but I've seen it before !
ALEX: I ’ Ve been told you might have a vacant room .
BLAKE:  Yes . I have a spare room .
ALEX:  How much are you asking ?
BLAKE:  10.00 dollars a night .
ALEX:  Could I see the room , please ?
BLAKE:  Sure.Come on in .
ALEX: Sit down , please . What's wrong with you ?
BLAKE:  I feel cold , and I'm shivering . I have a terrible headache and a sore throat .
ALEX:  How long have you been like that ?
BLAKE:  About a day .
ALEX:  Let me have a look at your throat first . Please open your mouth and say " ah " .
BLAKE:  Ah ...
ALEX:  And show me your tongue ... Thank you . That'll do . You have slight tonsillitis , and your throat is inflamed . How is your appetite ?
BLAKE:  Not so good .
ALEX:  Now , let me take your temperature . Please put this thermometer under your armpit and let me feel your pulse ?
BLAKE:  Your pulse is weak .
ALEX:  Do I have a temperature , doctor ?
BLAKE:  Yes , you have a high fever . I'd like to give you a blood test .
ALEX: Yikes ! What was that noise ?
BLAKE:  I had to blow my nose .
ALEX:  Did you have to blow right next to the phone ?
BLAKE:  Did you hear that ?
ALEX:  Of course I heard that . I thought a plane had crashed into your house .
BLAKE:  It wasn't that loud .
ALEX:  I will blow my nose sometime for you , and you'll see .
BLAKE:  Okay . I'll take your word for it .
ALEX:  I thought you had an elephant in your house .
BLAKE:  You're funny .
ALEX:  What did you say ? I think I've gone deaf .
BLAKE:  I'm going into the bathroom to blow my nose . I'll be right back .
ALEX: Can I have the check please ?
BLAKE:  Right away , sir .
ALEX:  Is this amount correct ?
BLAKE:  Yes , sir , it is .
ALEX:  Thank you , the service was good
BLAKE:  Please come again .
ALEX: Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive .
BLAKE:  What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them .
ALEX:  But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past .
BLAKE:  Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds .
ALEX: Okay , well I ’ m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position .
BLAKE:  Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify .
ALEX:  Well feel free to ask me anything , and I ’ ll try to fill in the details .
BLAKE:  Could I first ask about the remuneration package ?
ALEX:  Yes , of course . That ’ s quite an important point , isn ’ t it ? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK dollars per annum . This doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance also .
BLAKE:  I understand . And are there other bonuses included ?
ALEX:  Well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . But we could go through all the details of that at a later date .
BLAKE:  Well , Mr . Parsons , I am flexible when it comes to salary . The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me .
ALEX:  Excellent . Well , what other questions do you have Rebecca ?
ALEX: We need to take the accounts system offline to carry out the upgrade . But don't worry , it won't cause too much inconvenience . We're going to do it over the weekend .
BLAKE:  How long will the system be down for ?
ALEX:  We'll be taking everything offline in about two hours ' time . It'll be down for a minimum of twelve hours . If everything goes according to plan , it should be up again by 6 pm on Saturday .
BLAKE:  That's fine . We've allowed forty-eight hours to be on the safe side .
ALEX: Welcome to IBA . Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes , please . I'm here for an International Settlement . Our company has to effect payment , and it needs to be done today . Here's the advice slip for the payment .
ALEX:  Thanks . I'm sorry to say that you need to get this stamped . There is no stamp on this slip and it is essential before I can process it for you .
BLAKE:  I see . So , I need to stamp it . And sign it too ?
ALEX:  Yes , that's right . Down here , at the bottom right hand corner to show that you agree to pay the printed amount .
BLAKE:  I'll go back to the office and get it sorted and pop back later . Thanks , bye for now .
ALEX: That's the warehouse where the large items of office equipment are stored .
BLAKE:  If I ordered a desk today , how would it be before I got delivery in Scotland ?
ALEX:  Well , I think perhaps you'd better speak to our Production Manager , Mr . Yao . You'll meet him when we go over to the factory .
ALEX: Excuse me . I have just missed the connection plane due to the heavy fog in London . Can I change my ticket now ?
BLAKE:  Please Show your ticket and passport .
ALEX:  Here you are .
BLAKE:  Which flight do you want to change ?
ALEX:  The next one to my destination . I have to be there as soon as possible .

BLAKE:  Mmmm ... and exactly how many times did you enter it , please ?
ALEX:  Maybe three times . As I said , I always forget it .
BLAKE:  Ah ! Don't worry ; it's just a security measure . If someone uses a card and cannot get the right PIN after three attempts , the bank keeps the card in case it's stolen . Just contact the bank and we'll get it back to you .
ALEX:  Oh , I see . So if I call my branch they can sort everything out for me ?
BLAKE:  Yes , they'll be happy to help . Believe me , it happens to many people .
ALEX:  I'd better try harder to memorise my PIN in future . Thanks .
ALEX: Is this the counter to pick up parcels ?
BLAKE:  Yes , it is .
ALEX:  I want to pick up my parcels .
BLAKE:  Please show me your parcel order .
ALEX:  OK . Here you are .

BLAKE:  Yes , I'm glad we've had very pleasant cooperation in the previous years . And your achievement for promoting our clothes was great in the three years .
ALEX:  So , I wish to apply for the sole agency of your product in our local market . If you give us the agency , that will be more substantial for our cooperation .
BLAKE:  To be frank , you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country . I'd like to know some ideas of terms on which you would be willing to operate as our agent .
ALEX:  As we are a well-established company , we are very familiar with the customers ' needs . Besides , we can make full use of our good connections with the wholesalers and retailers here and develop a good market for your products if appointed as your agent .
BLAKE:  Sounds reasonable . I will tell my boss about you agent application . Another question , what do you think is the minimum annual sales you can guarantee ?

ALEX:  No , certainly not .
ALEX: Excuse me .

ALEX:  That's it ! All of them have first-class quality and performance . Besides , we adopt advanced technology . Now we have developed new products . They are much better than what you have bought .
BLAKE:  Your company is developing so fast . Maybe later on I will plan to buy more .
ALEX:  That's great ! Thanks for your support . If any , please remember to call us . I am afraid I have to say goodbye now ! Bye , Mr . James !
BLAKE:  Bye !
ALEX: Ms.Dawson , I need you to take a dictation for me .

ALEX:  I stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
BLAKE:  Did you get any perks on the job ?
ALEX:  Yeah , I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free .
ALEX: Hi . May I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes . What's the buying rate for euro ?

ALEX: Why are you reading the classifieds ? What do you need ?
BLAKE:  I'm looking for a bookcase , but I don't want to buy a new one .
ALEX:  Are you having any luck ?
BLAKE:  Not really . There aren't any used bookcases listed . But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday . I think I'll go to them .
ALEX:  Do you mind if I go with you ?
BLAKE:  Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
ALEX:  I learned to negotiate from my mother . I thought I was pretty good at bargaining , but I had a problem the other day at Kimble's Department Store .
BLAKE:  What happened ?
ALEX:  I wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . It was priced at forty dollars , so I started by offering the salesclerk thirty .
ALEX: Do you do a lot of your shopping online ?
BLAKE:  Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but lat
ALEX:  No . I ’ m a little worried about security . You never know who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ’ t you worry about that ?
BLAKE:  Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to sho
ALEX:  I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological .
BLAKE:  I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people .
ALEX:  So , how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
BLAKE:  Sure . I ’ d love to join you . Can we stop by the computer store ? I just want to see if they have something .
ALEX:  Sure . While you ’ re in the computer store . I will visit the book store opposite . I like to browse through their books and see if they have anything interesting .

ALEX:  Would you like to try my special recipe ?
BLAKE:  Wow , let me try . It tastes nice . How did you make it ?
ALEX:  It ’ s as easy as pie . I always follow recipes .
ALEX: Mr . Dick . Does the recommendation of the university play an important role ?
BLAKE:  Yes . In fact , the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation . In the long period of cooperation , the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations , they trust each other well . If your university recommends you , you can be approved more easily .
ALEX:  But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . So I doubt its authority .
BLAKE:  More and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . If your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you .
ALEX:  Could you tell me whether or not I send out my resume with it ?
BLAKE:  It depends . If it has something special or useful , I suggest you send it out .
ALEX: Taylor , can you tell me how to apply for a job on the Internet ?
BLAKE:  Just fill out an application .

BLAKE:  You are expected to know the E-mail address of the unit .
ALEX:  But I still don't know which unit is in need of staff .
BLAKE:  Send out an application through Job-wanted on the website .
ALEX:  Can any unit see my information ?
BLAKE:  It's a two-way choice . And your application will be read .
ALEX:  Which websites offer this service ?
BLAKE:  Sina , 21st Century Talent Net , and a few others .
ALEX:  Thank you .
ALEX: Don ’ t throw your weight around . I can ’ t bear you any more .
BLAKE:  I dare you to say that again .
ALEX: Were you a leader when you were in college ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I was Propaganda department minister of our university .
ALEX:  Did you get any honors or awards at your university ?
BLAKE:  No . It ’ s a pity about it .
ALEX:  Were you involved in any club activities at your university ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I was a member of the basketball Society . I like playing basketball .
ALEX:  What extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ?
BLAKE:  I sometimes played basketball and sometimes played football .
ALEX: You want to argue your ticket today ?
BLAKE:  Yes . That is why I'm here .
ALEX:  Tell me your argument .
BLAKE:  I was pulled over for allegedly speeding .
ALEX:  Are you sure you weren't speeding ?
BLAKE:  To be honest , I really wasn't .
ALEX:  What speed were you going ?
BLAKE:  I was under the speed limit . I was going 35 , when the speed limit was 40 .
ALEX:  I'm just going to let you go , since the arresting officer isn't here .
BLAKE:  What about my ticket ? Do I still need to pay ?
ALEX:  Don't worry about it .
BLAKE:  I'm so glad for your help .
ALEX: Annie , do you like shopping online ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I like it , because it's convenient .
ALEX:  Last week , I tried to buy a new cellphone online , but I didn't know how to pay for it .
BLAKE:  First , you should open an account at the online bank . After that , you can buy anything you want online .
ALEX:  Are there many things online ?
BLAKE:  Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let's check it out online ! ( They log in a shopping website . )
ALEX:  That's amazing . Oh , an on line virtual supermarket ?
BLAKE:  Let's click to check it out .
ALEX:  Oh , I got it . It simulates the real supermarket , which makes it feel so real . Mom will love it . She loves shopping in supermarkets .
ALEX: Ah , Bob . Just the person I wanted to see .
BLAKE:  So what is it ?
ALEX:  You gotta help me out this time , buddy .
BLAKE:  Another tough thing , I guess .
ALEX: Hey ! What happened ? ! My song was only half way through and it skipped to the next song .
BLAKE:  I don't know what happened !
ALEX:  You cancelled the song , didn't you , Jack ?
BLAKE:  No , I didn't . Really !
ALEX:  Then , is the machine broken or ...

ALEX:  You look pretty in red .
BLAKE:  Oh , it ’ s my favorite . How much is it ?
ALEX:  $ 29.99 .
BLAKE:  Okay . I ’ ll take it . Thank you very much for your help .
ALEX:  You ’ re welcome .
ALEX: Do you have any cars available ?
BLAKE:  We have only one mid-size car left .
ALEX:  Great , what's the rate per day ?

BLAKE:  I was wondering if the chef could leave off the sauce .
ALEX:  The chef would be happy to accommodate your special requests .
BLAKE:  I am a vegetarian . Do you have any vegetarian selections ?
ALEX:  You could choose the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza or the goat cheese and candied walnut salad .
BLAKE:  I think that we will split the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza .
ALEX:  That is a good selection , and I can bring your salads now or serve them with your entree .
BLAKE:  You can bring us our salads when you bring us our entree .
ALEX: I can't open this email attachment our Paris office has sent me .
BLAKE:  Are you sure you're using the right program ?

BLAKE:  Oh yes , and fruits . I love fruits very much .
ALEX:  What do you like to drink ?
BLAKE:  Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea .
ALEX:  Whatever would you like to drink ?
BLAKE:  I drink a lot of milk . I drink milk almost every day .
ALEX:  How often do you exercise ?
BLAKE:  Well , I walk every day .
ALEX:  It's a good diet and a regular exercise .
BLAKE:  Yes , quite right .
ALEX: I am sorry , but I cannot stay for the rest of class today .
BLAKE:  Why do you need to leave early ?
ALEX:  I don ’ t feel so good .
BLAKE:  What doesn ’ t feel right ?
ALEX:  I feel as if I am going to be sick to my stomach .
BLAKE:  Perhaps you should get checked out at the Student Health Center before you go home .
ALEX:  I have some medicine at home that I could take .
BLAKE:  Are you going to be OK to drive home , or would you like someone to go with you ?
ALEX:  Thank you , but my friend is in the library , and he can give me a ride home .
BLAKE:  We hope that you are feeling better soon . E-mail me if you have any questions .
ALEX: Your boyfriend is so considerate to you . When do you plan to marry ?
BLAKE:  It ’ s still up in the air . There is something wrong between us .
ALEX: We're considering of ordering 200 computers , but I'm wondering about the price you'll possibly offer .
BLAKE:  Our price will be not less than $ 5000 .
ALEX:  Your price is higher than I expected . Could you give us a little discount ?
BLAKE:  This is already our best price .
ALEX:  But the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order .
BLAKE:  Well , what would you suggest ?
ALEX:  Could you make it $ 4500 ?
BLAKE:  I'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price . This is the best price we can quote .
ALEX:  Can we meet each other half way ?
BLAKE:  What do you mean ?
ALEX:  Let's close the deal at $ 4800 , OK ?
BLAKE:  You drive a hard bargain ! OK , that's a deal .
ALEX: I'm now on the Songshan airport getting ready for departure . I realized that I might have left my watch .
BLAKE:  Yes , Ma'am . May I have your name and room number ?
ALEX:  My name is Terry . I stayed last night in your hotel in room 132 .
BLAKE:  What kind of watch is it ?
ALEX:  It's a brand-new Seiko wrist watch .
BLAKE:  Yes , we have it .
ALEX:  Oh , I'm glad to hear that . Would you kindly send it to the Hilton Hotel ?
ALEX: What are your thoughts on the apartment ?
BLAKE:  I think that it ’ s absolutely gorgeous .
ALEX:  There aren ’ t any problems with the apartment ?
BLAKE:  I think that the apartment looks very nice , but I do see some problems .
ALEX:  What problems ?
BLAKE:  I did notice a few stains in the carpet .
ALEX:  We will have the carpet cleaned before you move in .
BLAKE:  You will ?
ALEX:  Yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ?
BLAKE:  That was the only thing that I saw that was wrong with the apartment .
ALEX:  I ’ m happy that you find this apartment so appealing .
BLAKE:  It is . I love it .
ALEX: That China-gown of Tang-Dynasty style is so beautiful . Would you show it to me , please ?
BLAKE:  Absolutely . Here it is .
ALEX:  Could I try it on ?
BLAKE:  Please do , the fitting-room is over there .
ALEX:  It feels a little tight around the waist . Do you have a bigger one ?
BLAKE:  I'm sorry . We don't have this color in your size . We have some green ones in your size . Would you please have a look at this green one ?
ALEX:  OK . How much does it cost ?
BLAKE:  It's 486 yuan .
ALEX: Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ?
BLAKE:  As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap .
ALEX:  Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling .
BLAKE:  So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide .
ALEX:  The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ?
BLAKE:  To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken .
ALEX:  That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut .
BLAKE:  I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion .
ALEX:  Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ?
BLAKE:  Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ?
ALEX:  Good . Friday morning at 9 .
ALEX: Good morning .
BLAKE:  Good morning.This is Mary.Can I speak to Anne please ?
ALEX:  I ’ m sorry She isn ’ t in at the momment.She will come back at half past nineCan I take a message for her ?
BLAKE:  Thank you.But I will call her later
ALEX:  OK.Goodbye .
BLAKE:  Goodbye .
ALEX: Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m all right , thanks . Just a little tired .
ALEX:  Late night ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , I got home around two .
ALEX: We've been waiting here for nearly ten minutes now , and there still isn't a bus in sight .
BLAKE:  I'm afraid we'll be late for the party .
ALEX:  Have you got the time , Tom ?
BLAKE:  Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch !
ALEX:  But you bought it only last month .
BLAKE:  Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired .
ALEX:  How long will it take us to get there ?
BLAKE:  I think about ten minutes by bus .
ALEX:  It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain .
BLAKE:  Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus .
ALEX: Hi , Mr . Smith . I'm Doctor Hawkins . Why are you here today ?
BLAKE:  I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up .
ALEX:  Yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . You should have one every year .
BLAKE:  I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ?
ALEX:  Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So try to come at least once a year for your own good .
BLAKE:  Ok .
ALEX:  Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ?
BLAKE:  Yes .
ALEX:  Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit .
BLAKE:  I've tried hundreds of times , but I just can't seem to kick the habit .
ALEX:  Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I'll give you more information before you leave .
BLAKE:  Ok , thanks doctor .
ALEX: Good afternoon . Mr . Tylor's office ?
BLAKE:  I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension .
ALEX:  I'm sorry , but could you please transfer this call to Mr . Tylor's office ?
BLAKE:  Sure , please hold on .
ALEX:  Thank you .
BLAKE:  Now Mr . Tylor's on the line . Go ahead , please .
ALEX:  You are so kind , you helped me a lot .
BLAKE:  You are welcome . Bye !
ALEX: Good afternoon , Lexington Software . Angelina Dawson , how can I help ?
BLAKE:  Hello , this is Quinn from IBA .
ALEX:  Ah , hello Quinn . Oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , aren't you ?
BLAKE:  I'm afraid so , yes .
ALEX:  Hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! Is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ?
BLAKE:  Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake .
ALEX:  What do you recommend we do ?
BLAKE:  I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible .
ALEX:  I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now .
ALEX: Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache .
BLAKE:  You should go to the dentist .
ALEX:  I hate dentists .
BLAKE:  Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .
ALEX:  It always hurts . I hate going .
BLAKE:  Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
ALEX:  O . K . , O . K . , I ’ ll go .
BLAKE:  Good . You'll feel better after you do .
ALEX: Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please .
BLAKE:  Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm .
ALEX:  How long does it take to get there ?
BLAKE:  About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ’ d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive .
ALEX:  Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time !
BLAKE:  Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers .
ALEX:  Great ! I ’ ll take it .
BLAKE:  Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train !
ALEX:  I understand . Thank you very much !
BLAKE:  Have a great trip .
ALEX: I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend .
BLAKE:  A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ?
ALEX:  The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend .
BLAKE:  So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ?
ALEX:  It sounds like it will be .
BLAKE:  I really hope it doesn't get cold .
ALEX:  That would ruin things , I want to go so badly .
BLAKE:  The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know .
ALEX:  That is true . The weather is constantly changing .
BLAKE:  It would be nice if the weather would never change .
ALEX:  That would be great , then we could plan things sooner .
BLAKE:  True . Predictable weather would make life easier .
ALEX: Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other .
BLAKE:  If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company .
ALEX:  Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating .
BLAKE:  But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency .
ALEX:  I doubt that .
ALEX: Do you eat a lot of healthy food ?
BLAKE:  Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind .
ALEX:  You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt .
BLAKE:  What's special about these things ?
ALEX:  Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .
BLAKE:  Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now .
ALEX: I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job .
BLAKE:  You need to take a break , maybe a vacation .
ALEX:  Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment .
BLAKE:  Is that so ?
ALEX:  Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .
BLAKE:  Have you decided ?
ALEX:  Yes . I want to get a better job .
BLAKE:  Could you tell me why you want to quit ?
ALEX:  I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
BLAKE:  Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?
ALEX:  I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .
BLAKE:  OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
ALEX:  Thank you so much for your advice .
BLAKE:  And every best wish for your new job .
ALEX:  Thank you .
ALEX: The train is leaving . Hurry up ! Which car are we in ?
BLAKE:  Let me see . Oh , No . 11 .
ALEX:  Here we are , Car 11 . Let's get in .
BLAKE:  Seats No . 20 and 21 . It ’ s nice that we ’ Ve got a window seat .
ALEX:  Let's put our suitcases on the rack .
BLAKE:  Oh , the baggage rack is full . Put them under the seat for the time being .
ALEX:  All right .
ALEX: So , how should we get to the theatre ?
BLAKE:  Let's take the bus .
ALEX:  I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .
BLAKE:  It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .
ALEX:  It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .
BLAKE:  We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .
ALEX:  Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .
BLAKE:  If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?
ALEX:  We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi .
BLAKE:  I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .
ALEX:  Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .
BLAKE:  It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .
ALEX:  Thanks , that was nice of you .
BLAKE:  See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !
ALEX: Let's go over this plan again .
BLAKE:  From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg .
ALEX:  And that is mostly flat , right ?
BLAKE:  Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba .
ALEX:  And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ?
BLAKE:  That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop .
ALEX:  It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride .
BLAKE:  Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ?
ALEX: Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ?
BLAKE:  I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her .
ALEX:  I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet .
BLAKE:  Anyhow , I'd like to change our room .
ALEX:  No problem , sir . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from .
BLAKE:  All right . I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep .
ALEX:  Be sure . I'll make a note of that . Everything will be taken care of . And if there is anything more you need , please let us know .
ALEX: It's time for bed .
BLAKE:  I'm not ready to go to sleep . I'm not tired .
ALEX:  It's quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow .
BLAKE:  I'm not going to be able to fall asleep .
ALEX:  Why don't you try counting sheep ?
BLAKE:  I've tried that before . It really doesn't work .
ALEX:  That's beside the point , you still need to go to bed .
BLAKE:  Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep ?
ALEX:  If I let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night .
BLAKE:  I promise I'll go to sleep soon .
ALEX:  No , you're going to sleep now , so good night .
BLAKE:  See you in the morning .
ALEX: I see myself as being honest , diligent , persevering and creative . And I have a strong sense of responsibility .
BLAKE:  How about your psychological resilience ?
ALEX:  I think I can work well under pressure , if necessary .
BLAKE:  How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ?
ALEX:  I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way .
BLAKE:  You seem to be a kind-hearted lady .
ALEX:  Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature .
BLAKE:  Please tell me your weaknesses if you can .
ALEX:  I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection .
ALEX: Karen ? I need to go over a few things with you .
BLAKE:  Certainly . Mr . Graham . When would you like to meet ?
ALEX:  I was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting .
BLAKE:  Fine . At 3:30 ?
ALEX: I believe we ' Ve met before . My name's David .
BLAKE:  Yes , at your company , I think . I'm Frank .
ALEX:  Oh , I remember now.Very nice to meet you again .
BLAKE:  Nice meeting you , too .
ALEX: I made my little brother cry .
BLAKE:  Shame on you !
ALEX: I need some mascara . Do you have good thickening mascara ?
BLAKE:  Of course . Here is our thickening mascara . We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes .
ALEX:  Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too . Do you have a color chart can look at ?
BLAKE:  We have a very wide selection of colors . And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . So it is very gentle on your eyelids . Would you like to sample some ?
ALEX:  Oh , sure I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first .
BLAKE:  I can help you with that .
ALEX:  Thank you .
ALEX: Is this the baggage claim area for flight KB256 ?
BLAKE:  Yes , we are on the same plane .
ALEX:  But I am a transfer passenger . I have a connecting flight to Miami .
BLAKE:  So you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area .
ALEX:  Yes.It ' s quite troublesome .
BLAKE:  Why not go and find a porter ?
ALEX: Billy , you don ’ t look too well . Maybe you should take the day off school .
BLAKE:  But Mom ! Today we ’ re playing football ! I love football !
ALEX:  You ’ Ve got a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ’ s that on your arm ?
BLAKE:  I don ’ t know . It was there when I woke up this morning .
ALEX:  It ’ s rash . I ’ d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ?
BLAKE:  I bashed it against the chair in my room .
ALEX:  Does it hurt ?
BLAKE:  A little , but not much .
ALEX:  Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ’ ll take you to the doctor ’ s after breakfast .
BLAKE:  If I ’ m better this afternoon , can I go to school ?
ALEX:  If you are better , but I doubt you will be .
ALEX: This is your schedule .
BLAKE:  You're going out of your way for us , I believe .
ALEX:  You are our honored guests .
ALEX: Are there any vacancies still available ?
BLAKE:  Yes . We need a plumber here .
ALEX:  I am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager .
BLAKE:  I am sorry . They are not available now .
ALEX: My name is Mary , and I will be your waitress tonight .
BLAKE:  Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant .
ALEX:  Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ?
BLAKE:  Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ?
ALEX:  There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table .
BLAKE:  The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ?
ALEX:  You know , that is one of my favorites !
BLAKE:  OK , I'll take one order of that .
ALEX:  You could choose another appetizer for half price to share .
BLAKE:  Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings .
ALEX: I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there's something wrong with the fax machine .
BLAKE:  What's wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ?
ALEX:  Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ?
BLAKE:  Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out .
ALEX: I would like to speak to you , if you don ’ t mind .
BLAKE:  What would you like to speak to me about ?
ALEX:  I would like to talk to you about this year ’ s election .
BLAKE:  Is that right ?
ALEX:  I am a volunteer for this year ’ s campaign .
BLAKE:  That ’ s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand .
ALEX:  I know history is about to be made , and I would like to be a part of it .
BLAKE:  That ’ s fantastic .
ALEX:  Are you planning on voting ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m going to vote .
ALEX:  Go to your polling place early on Election Day .
BLAKE:  I will . Good luck with your volunteering .
ALEX: We hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future .
BLAKE:  Yes . I promise it will not happen again .
ALEX:  We look forward to your settlement at an early date .
BLAKE:  We will inform you as soon as possible .
ALEX: Hello , Steven . How do you get along with your job ?
BLAKE:  Actually , I learn many things from it . I find that I am a quick learner in new things .
ALEX:  Practice makes perfect . By the way , what do you learn from your job ?
BLAKE:  At first I didn't know anything about the machine . Now I know how to operate it . Besides , the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement .
ALEX:  Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance .
BLAKE:  Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job .
ALEX:  I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work .
BLAKE:  OK , let's go .
ALEX: Where on earth are we ?
BLAKE:  Judging by all the traffic , I'd say we're near the outskirts of the city .
ALEX:  What did I do wrong ? Did I take a wrong turn ?
BLAKE:  I'm not sure , but I think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge .
ALEX:  Well , now we should turn back a few kilometres .
BLAKE:  It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map .
ALEX: Hello . Front desk .
BLAKE:  Yes . This is Bob Robinson . I ’ m calling from room number 627 .
ALEX:  Hi , Bob . What can I do for you ?
BLAKE:  Is it possible to change to another room ?
ALEX:  Could you please tell me why ?
BLAKE:  My room is facing the swimming pool . It ’ s noisy for me . I have a problem sleeping . And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator .
ALEX:  So you need a quiet side room on the lower floor .
BLAKE:  You ’ re right .
ALEX:  Okay . Let me check for a room on the first floor .
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX:  I ’ Ve only two rooms on the first floor . How about room 108 ?
BLAKE:  That ’ s fine . Can I move now ?
ALEX:  Sure . I ’ ll send the bellman to help you .
BLAKE:  Oh , thank you kindly .
ALEX:  You ’ re welcome .
ALEX: How long will it take for our order to be delivered ?
BLAKE:  Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles .
ALEX:  Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control .
BLAKE:  No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go .
ALEX: Now you're my boss , Mr . Henry .
BLAKE:  Do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
ALEX:  No , nothing in particular .
BLAKE:  You may ask questions about us , if you have any .
ALEX:  All right . When can I start ?
ALEX: What are you doing here today ?
BLAKE:  I would like to fight my ticket .
ALEX:  Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today ?
BLAKE:  Yes , the officer is here today .
ALEX:  What's your case ?
BLAKE:  I was pulled over for running a red light , but I never did .
ALEX:  Do you believe that the officer lied ?
BLAKE:  There was a camera on the signal . So , he was obviously lying .
ALEX:  Your license plate was caught on camera ?
BLAKE:  A picture of my license plate was never taken .
ALEX:  Since there is no picture of your license plate on record , I'm going to let you go .
BLAKE:  Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me .
ALEX: Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ?
BLAKE:  Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long .
ALEX:  Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices .
BLAKE:  That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options .
ALEX:  What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ?
BLAKE:  Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into .
ALEX:  So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?
BLAKE:  Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .
ALEX:  Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will .
BLAKE:  After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice .
ALEX: what shall we do after the volleyball match ?
BLAKE:  how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym .
ALEX:  that's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
BLAKE:  me , too . What did you have in mind ?
ALEX:  I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must .
BLAKE:  I agree . They're very lovely , especially " Huan Huan " .
ALEX:  is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ?
BLAKE:  the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive .
ALEX:  oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ?
BLAKE:  I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now .
ALEX:  any other ideas ?
BLAKE:  there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts .
ALEX:  it all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have .
ALEX: Mom ! I hate eating vegetables !
BLAKE:  You don ’ t have to eat them . I don ’ t mind .
ALEX:  Thanks mom ! Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake !
BLAKE:  No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables .
ALEX:  But I don ’ t like them ! It ’ s not fair !
BLAKE:  You can have some fruit for dessert . If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake .
ALEX:  Ok ... actually , I don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots , buy I hate broccoli and cauliflower .
BLAKE:  I ’ ll remember that for next time . You ’ ll get extra peas and carrots , buy no broccoli or cauliflower . OK ?
ALEX:  Thanks mom !
ALEX: It was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place . It gave me a good idea of your product range .
BLAKE:  It ’ s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . What ’ s your general impression , may I ask ?
ALEX:  Very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your NW Model .
BLAKE:  That ’ s our latest development . A product with high performance . We put it on the market just two months ago .
ALEX:  The machine gives you an edge over your competitors , I guess .
BLAKE:  Certainly . No one can match us as far as speed is concerned .
ALEX:  Could you give me some brochures for that machine ? And the price if possible .
BLAKE:  Right . Here is our sales catalog and literature .
ALEX:  Thank you . I think we may be able to work together in the future .
ALEX: Is the factory fully-automated ?
BLAKE:  Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually .
ALEX:  What about supply of parts to the production line ?
BLAKE:  Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line .
ALEX:  What about the smaller components ?
BLAKE:  They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory .
ALEX: I'm glad you're on your ten-year reunion planning committee .
BLAKE:  Yeah , you get the TV to yourself while I spend my nights surfing the Net for missing classmates .
ALEX:  That's not why . This way I can see how you guys do this sort of thing .
BLAKE:  I guess . Don't you have reunions in Taiwan ?
ALEX:  Definitely . Every year . But just for our forty-person class .
BLAKE:  Ours are for everyone that graduated in the same year .
ALEX: What does your job involve ?
BLAKE:  I'm the Project Manager so I have to make sure our projects run smoothly . I work with three Project Engineers . They take care of after-sales service and look after the maintenance side of the business .
ALEX: How many languages can you speak ?
BLAKE:  Besides Chinese , I can speak English and French .
ALEX:  You mean you can read and write both of them ?
BLAKE:  No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French .
ALEX:  Can you read and write English well ?
BLAKE:  I can speak the language better than read and write .
ALEX:  Do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of English-speaking countries ?
BLAKE:  I think so . I used to be an interpreter .
ALEX:  Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work ?
BLAKE:  The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm .
ALEX: What can I get for you ? Here is the menu .
BLAKE:  Let me have a look . Well , how many kinds of steaks do you have ?
ALEX:  We have sirloin steaks , pepper steak , and filet steak .
BLAKE:  Is there something go with the filet steak ?
ALEX:  Yes , we have various sauces . What about the gravy ?
ALEX: Are you ready to go shopping ?
BLAKE:  Just a minute . I need to make a list of thinks that we need .
ALEX:  Good idea . Have you written down potatoes , carrots , and onions ?
BLAKE:  I don ’ t have onions on my list . I ’ ll add them . We should get some tea . Is green tea ok or should we get the same tea that we usually get ?
ALEX:  Let ’ s get both . We need some coffee too . Is that on your list ?
BLAKE:  Yes , it is . Here ’ s my list . Is there anything that I ’ Ve forgotten ?
ALEX:  I think you ’ Ve got everything . I want to got some chocolate and some cheese .
BLAKE:  What kind of cheese do you want .
ALEX:  I ’ m not sure . I ’ ll decide at the cheese counter , when I can see what they have . Have we got enough money ?
BLAKE:  We don ’ t have enough cash , so I ’ ll take my credit card and we can pay with that . Where are the car keys ?
ALEX:  I ’ Ve got them there . Shall I drive ?
ALEX: Hello , can you tell me how to use the telephone ?
BLAKE:  If you want to order meals , call 8801.If you need other help , call 8803 and someone will be there .
ALEX:  Thank you so much . By the way , is there a mail service ?
BLAKE:  Yes , you can take your letters to the counter over there .
ALEX: Hi , I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . A technician has just come and checked it . He will bring me a new one tomorrow . It seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . Can I use the one in your office ?
BLAKE:  Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ?
ALEX:  Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
BLAKE:  Yes , it will print immediately .
ALEX: How many years have you done business with China ?
BLAKE:  Let me see , about five years , we established our business relationship with Hua Mei of China Import & Export Corporation in 2003 .
ALEX:  Do you have any difficulties in doing business in China ? You know the Chinese economic legislation is still incomplete ?
BLAKE:  I don't think I have any problem with our Chinese partners . They have always followed the contract strictly . We can do business directly with the corporation . As I mentioned before , the Chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law . Its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies .
ALEX:  Well , it's known that the Sino-American relation is in a dilemma . Does it influence your business in China ?
BLAKE:  Actually not at present . But we are afraid it will . You know policies influence business to some extent . I hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists . China is really a large market . We don't want to lose it .
ALEX:  Thank you .
BLAKE:  You're welcome .
ALEX: Give me a pack of first-class stamps , please .
BLAKE:  Here you are . That will be five dollars . Anything else ?
ALEX:  Yes . I want some post cards and some airmail stamps . I want to send some letters to South America .
BLAKE:  Just a moment , I'll look up the rate for air-mail letters to South America .
ALEX:  Can you tell me how much it will cost to send a package to Colombia ? Also , I what to know how long it will take .
BLAKE:  Do you have the package with you ? I would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost .
ALEX:  Do you insure package ?
BLAKE:  Yes . All you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for .
ALEX:  Is there a way that I can be sure that the people in South america receive my package ?
BLAKE:  The post office rarely loses package . You can , however , request a rectum receipt .
ALEX:  One last question-what are your hours ?
BLAKE:  We open at eight-thirty in the morning and close at five-thirty in the afternoon .
ALEX:  Thank you , you helped me a lot .
ALEX: Hello , thank you for taking the time to interview me .
BLAKE:  Hi there , I ’ m Bill Gotcha , the owner of Gotcha Enterprises . Did you find your way here OK ?
ALEX:  Your assistant gave wonderful directions .
BLAKE:  Why are you switching jobs at this point in your career ?
ALEX:  Our Company is moving overseas and I wish to stay in the United States .
BLAKE:  What are you best at ?
ALEX:  I am good at organizing systems that have been having problems .
BLAKE:  What is your biggest challenge in terms of skills ?
ALEX:  I don ’ t like to sit around and so like to always find things to do to keep myself busy .
BLAKE:  That is good to hear !
ALEX: Good morning . SRC international . How may I help you ?
BLAKE:  Good morning . I'd like to speak to Peter . Chen Please .
ALEX:  Certainly . Who should I say is calling ?
BLAKE:  This is Tim . Hunter from Hunter industries .
ALEX:  And what is it regarding please ?
BLAKE:  We have an appointment for this afternoon . Mr . Chen will know why I'm calling .
ALEX:  Of course , Please hold the line Mr . Hunter .
ALEX: Right , let me run through your options . You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to , but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan .
BLAKE:  OK , what does that entail ?
ALEX:  It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances .
BLAKE:  Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ?
ALEX:  Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate .
BLAKE:  I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ?
ALEX:  Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu .
BLAKE:  Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today .
ALEX: My aunt told me one of her secrets--cellophane tape .
BLAKE:  I just got it at the special health store . It's for my flabby arms .
ALEX:  Let me know how it works .
BLAKE:  I have to say , I have had enough of this roller coaster .
ALEX:  I know what you mean . I'm like a yo-yo .
BLAKE:  Last week I was down to 60 kilos . This week I had one donut more . Now I'm up to 62 kilos .
ALEX: May I have a menu , please ?
BLAKE:  Of course .
ALEX:  Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ?
BLAKE:  Lobster ? It is steamed and served with our special sauce .
ALEX:  Is it good ?
BLAKE:  Sure . It is a most popular dish .
ALEX:  I think I will try some lobster , and give me some green salad together .
ALEX: Can ’ t you come in and have tea now , Peter ?
BLAKE:  Not yet , I must water the garden first .
ALEX:  Do you have to water it now ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m afraid I must . Look at it ! It ’ s terribly dry .
ALEX:  What a nuisance !
BLAKE:  Last summer it was very dry , too . Don ’ t you remember ? I had to water it every day .
ALEX:  Well , I ’ ll have tea by myself . That was quick ! Have you finished already ?
BLAKE:  Yes , Look out of the window .
ALEX:  It ’ s raining . That means you needn ’ t water the garden .
BLAKE:  That was a pleasant surprise . It means I can have tea , instead .
ALEX: I'm broke , and I have to catch another bus .
BLAKE:  Why don't you have any money for another bus ?
ALEX:  I got hungry and bought some chips .
BLAKE:  That was smart .
ALEX:  Anyway , do you have any change I can use for the bus ?
BLAKE:  I don't have any .
ALEX:  I don't know how I'm going to get home .
BLAKE:  Get a transfer from the bus driver .
ALEX:  How much is a transfer ?
BLAKE:  It doesn't cost anything .
ALEX:  That's great ! Thanks for your help .
BLAKE:  You know what ? Don't mention it .
ALEX: Hello , Anna . Come in and sit down .
BLAKE:  Hello , doctor .
ALEX:  What's the matter ?
BLAKE:  I've got a backache .
ALEX:  Do you often suffer from backache ?

ALEX:  When did it start ?
BLAKE:  About four days ago .
ALEX:  Well , go home and rest in bed for two days , then you'll feel better .
BLAKE:  Can you give me some medicine ? It's very painful .

ALEX: An idea about killing time on a train ?
BLAKE:  I advise you to read Playboy.You can get a lot from it .
ALEX:  But there's quite a lot of rumors about it .
BLAKE:  That's why it's interesting .
ALEX: Have you brought the receipt with you ?
BLAKE:  No , I don't . I left it home .
ALEX:  Sorry , but we can't do anything without the receipt . Come back with it .

ALEX:  Are you often traveling by plane ?
BLAKE:  No , this is the second time .
ALEX:  That's right . It's normal if you don't often take the plane . Just relax a little bit .
BLAKE:  Why this happens to me when I am on the plane ? I feel bad .
ALEX:  Don't worry , sir . It's just because of the lower pressure .
BLAKE:  What should I do about it ?
ALEX:  You may feel much better if you chew some gum or peanuts .

ALEX:  Did you have the room checked before we move in ?
BLAKE:  Which room are you in ?
ALEX:  1808 . The toilet doesn ’ t work properly ; the water doesn ’ t run in the shower .

ALEX: I would like to open an account please .
BLAKE:  Do you have any form of ID ?
ALEX:  I have my Tennis Club card . Is that good enough ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m afraid not . It has to be a passport or a valid driver ’ s license .
ALEX:  Oh ... wait a minute ... here ’ s my driver ’ s license .

BLAKE:  Hello . I'm not sure who I need to speak to . I got this 50 yuan note today and it seems a little odd to me .
ALEX:  The first thing we do is check the feel of the paper ;d oes it feel too thick or too thin ? Then we check the watermark . In my opinion it is counterfeit . I'll just run it through the scanner to double check .
BLAKE:  What happens now ?
ALEX:  Well , it's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . So , unfortunately you'll lose this 50 RIB . We'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .

ALEX:  Could it be the battery ?
BLAKE:  No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago.It must be other problems .
ALEX:  Well , I suppose it could be the gas .
BLAKE:  No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday .

ALEX:  Are you in robust health ?
BLAKE:  I have a little problem , I'm overweight for my height . I think I should go on a diet .
ALEX: The consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us . We have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality I am afraid .
BLAKE:  Is there anything wrong ?
ALEX:  We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard .
BLAKE:  It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ?
ALEX:  Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally
BLAKE:  Well . According to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . We ’ ll send our technicians to repair them .
ALEX:  Forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . You should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee .
BLAKE:  I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee .
ALEX:  All right . In that case we are still willing to do business with you .
ALEX: Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday .
BLAKE:  Oh where was that ?
ALEX:  I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track .
BLAKE:  Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . She is always making us kids eat the proper foods .
ALEX:  Well , it pays off for her . How old is she anyway ?
BLAKE:  She will be 86 next month .
ALEX:  That is truly amazing !
ALEX: Did you punch in ?
BLAKE:  Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable !
ALEX:  Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it .
BLAKE:  Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ?
ALEX:  Sure , when those never ending meetings .
ALEX: I don't think you've met my sister , Mary .
BLAKE:  No , I haven't had the pleasure .
ALEX:  Come and meet her now .
BLAKE:  All right .
ALEX: Excuse me , would you tell me how to return to Hilton Hotel . I'm afraid I lost my way .
BLAKE:  Did you have hotel card or something ?
ALEX:  Let me see . Yes , I have the address and hotel telephone number here .
BLAKE:  Oh , you stay at the down town Hilton . When you go down two blocks this way and turn left , you will find it on your right .
ALEX:  I don't understand very well . Could you give me a map ?
ALEX: The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ?
BLAKE:  I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself .
ALEX:  So , let ’ s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ’ t they ?
BLAKE:  Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced .
ALEX:  How long did it take you to do the tiling .
BLAKE:  As I hadn ’ t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether .
ALEX:  I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ?
BLAKE:  You ’ ll be lucky ! However , I ’ ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself .
ALEX: I'd like to see that pen , please .
BLAKE:  You mean this one ?
ALEX:  No , the other one in the brown case .
BLAKE:  Oh , this one ... Here .
ALEX:  May I try it ?
BLAKE:  Sure .
ALEX:  It's very smooth . I'll take it .
BLAKE:  Cash or charge ?
ALEX:  Charge , please .
ALEX: I ’ Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles .
BLAKE:  We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days .
ALEX:  Why , your price has soared . It ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price .
BLAKE:  I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere .
ALEX:  I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources .
BLAKE:  But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries .
ALEX:  I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ’ t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years .
BLAKE:  There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price .
ALEX:  Well , we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ’ ll have to try , I suppose .
ALEX: Good morning.sir.My name is Liu Peng from Tsinghai University . I am here for the interview relating to my visa application .
BLAKE:  Glad to meet you.Would you mind if I ask you some questions ?
ALEX:  Of course not .
BLAKE:  Why do you want to go to the US ?
ALEX:  I'd like to have further education.Now I am studying for my doctorate .
BLAKE:  Will you get any kind of scholarship ?
ALEX:  Yes . The school has provided me with full scholarship and that will be enough to support myself .
ALEX: Could you say something about your educational background ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I graduated from shanghai University and later obtained a master's degree from Oxford .
ALEX:  What was your graduation thesis on ?
BLAKE:  My graduation thesis is on International Trade .
ALEX: Hello , I'd like to open an account .

ALEX:  Is there any minimum deposit for the first time ?
BLAKE:  Yes , the opening minimum deposit is 1,000 Yuan .

BLAKE:  I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new .

BLAKE:  I would rather work full-time .
ALEX:  I'll make note of that . Now , what are your salary expectations ?
BLAKE:  I am willing to negotiate , but I expect at least $ 40,000 a year .
ALEX: My lease ends next month , so I have to find a new place .
BLAKE:  I feel sorry for you . It's a jungle out there .
ALEX:  Do you know any places ?
BLAKE:  Well . I guess I can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available .
ALEX:  Thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet .
BLAKE:  How much do are you looking to spend ?
ALEX:  I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month .
BLAKE:  Looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs .

BLAKE:  Anything you need to have in the place ?
ALEX:  I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side .
BLAKE:  You can also check out university bulletin boards .

ALEX:  What is your argument ?
BLAKE:  Your Honor , the police officer pulled me over for speeding .
ALEX:  You must've been speeding .
BLAKE:  No , Your Honor , I was not .
ALEX:  Tell me how many miles per hour you were going .
BLAKE:  I was going 35 in a 40 mph zone .
ALEX:  That's fine , so I'll let you go with a warning .
BLAKE:  So , I don't have to pay the ticket ?
ALEX:  You won't have to pay the fine .
BLAKE:  Thank you very much , Your Honor .
ALEX: Yes ! I finally lost that last five pounds I've been working on forever !
BLAKE:  How did you finally do it ?
ALEX:  A friend suggested that I stop nibbling between meals .
BLAKE:  Like snacking ?
ALEX:  You know , a little piece of chocolate here , some chips on the side , candy now and then ...
BLAKE:  I get what you mean .
ALEX:  Instead , I sit down and have a good snack like a piece of fruit between meals .
BLAKE:  I'm impressed . Good for you !

BLAKE:  All right . Let me have a check . Can you tell me how can you inspect your exported goods ?
ALEX:  Our quality control department is in charge of the inspection , which is directly under general manager . It is essential to attach the importance to the quality of goods . It is the basement for the future cooperation .
BLAKE:  That is good . And here I give you a piece of advice . You should have used stronger cardboard boxes for such a heavy item . Besides , it's better to secure the cartons with metal straps . What's more , the order number wasn't anywhere on some of the boxes .
ALEX:  I realize that now . I will do that after a while .
BLAKE:  Thank you . Can I open the packages to check the color and style ?
ALEX:  Of course , let me help you .
BLAKE:  The color and style are consistent with the sample . Great !
ALEX:  You know , we are superior to other clothes companies .
BLAKE:  Yes , that's for sure . There is nothing wrong with the quality . I think you'd better pack them first in plastic bags , than in cartons .
ALEX:  OK . We will manage it later .

ALEX:  Yes , please sit on the chair.How do you want to have your hair cut ?
BLAKE:  Not too long.Cut a little off behind and on both sides , too .
ALEX:  OK.Now lean back a little and keep still . I'm going to shave your face .
ALEX: How long have we been flying ?
BLAKE:  About 12 hours .
ALEX:  I always have trouble with jet lag .
BLAKE:  Most people do when they travel long distances .
ALEX:  By the way , what's the time now ?
BLAKE:  8: 00 Beijing time .
ALEX: How do I use this adhesive ?
BLAKE:  This is a special adhesive for easing the pain . Apply it to the painful area and change it in every 2 days .
ALEX:  How do I use the lotion ?
BLAKE:  Apply some of the ointment , and rub it into the skin .
ALEX:  Well , thanks very much .
BLAKE:  Not at all .
ALEX: Cindy . We were going to try to surprise you for your birthday . But you ’ re just too busy ! Can you tell me when you ’ ll be free ?
BLAKE:  Oh , Brian . That ’ s really sweet of you guys . I would love to get together with all of you . How about Friday ?
ALEX:  Great ! What time ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m free all afternoon . Why don ’ t we meet at 1 o ’ clock in the lobby ?
ALEX: I ’ ll need to meet with you before you go on vacation , Alex . I have a few things to clear up .
BLAKE:  I ’ ll be glad to . But my schedule is super tight this week . I think the only time I have free is at lunch on Wednesday .
ALEX:  That ’ s fine . I can make that .
BLAKE:  All right , then . I ’ ll see you at noon on Wednesday .
ALEX: I've got a temperature and my stomach hurts .
BLAKE:  How long have you been feeling this way ?
ALEX:  It all started the day before yesterday .
BLAKE:  You seem to have picked up some kind of infection .
ALEX:  What should I do ?
BLAKE:  Take a few days off from work and don't wear yourself out .
ALEX: What would you like to eat tonight ?
BLAKE:  I'm not sure , what about you ?
ALEX:  Do you think Kentucky fried chicken is good ?
BLAKE:  Sure sounds good to me .
ALEX: Did you clean your room today ?
BLAKE:  No , not yet .
ALEX:  Well , when were you planning on doing that ?
BLAKE:  I'm going to clean it up later .
ALEX:  Didn't I ask you to clean it up earlier ?
BLAKE:  I'm going to clean it .
ALEX:  I want you to vacuum in your room , and don't forget to dust everything .
BLAKE:  I know . I'll do it .
ALEX:  Make sure you clean it up before you do anything else .
BLAKE:  I'm not going anywhere until later , so I'll clean it then .
ALEX: Hello , can I help ?
BLAKE:  I'm from Lexington Software and I'm here to collect an export L / C .
ALEX:  I have it right here .
BLAKE:  Great . Can I take it with me now ? Or do you need me to fill in some forms or something ?
ALEX:  No , you can take it away now . I just need you to sign here .
BLAKE:  Here you are .
ALEX:  Just one thing before you go , could you please prepare your documents in accordance with the L / C within the validity period ?
BLAKE:  No problem , I'll get on that right away . Thanks , bye .
ALEX: Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ?
BLAKE:  What do you need ?
ALEX:  I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him .
BLAKE:  He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
ALEX: I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable !
BLAKE:  Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .
ALEX:  He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .
BLAKE:  I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .
ALEX:  I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me .
BLAKE:  Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss .
ALEX:  Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
BLAKE:  Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper .
ALEX:  I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?
BLAKE:  I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions .
ALEX: hey , you look great ! how's everything ?
BLAKE:  yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit .
ALEX:  really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work .
BLAKE:  it's important to do proper exercises .
ALEX:  you're right . Too much or too little won't do any good .
BLAKE:  the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
ALEX:  sounds reasonable .
BLAKE:  we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
ALEX:  and fruits !
BLAKE:  surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .
ALEX:  I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
BLAKE:  yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can help one to keep sound physical health .
ALEX:  I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .
BLAKE:  you bet it !
ALEX: Staying out all night , you frightened me to death .
BLAKE:  I stayed with my friends .
ALEX:  You should at least give me a call .
BLAKE:  I'm sorry , Mum .
ALEX: Did anyone call ?
BLAKE:  Just Mr . White .
ALEX:  What did he want ?
BLAKE:  He wouldn't say over the phone .
ALEX: What kind of job do you intend to do ?
BLAKE:  I want to do some management job since I have three-year's work history .
ALEX:  What are your plans if you were hired ?
BLAKE:  I would apply my specialty and experience to my job and gradually move up to the management level in this company .
ALEX: You stepped on my foot !
BLAKE:  Sorry . I didn't mean to .
ALEX: what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ?
BLAKE:  while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement .
ALEX:  why not ?
BLAKE:  the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing !
ALEX:  it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking .
BLAKE:  I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children .
ALEX:  I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking .
BLAKE:  all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty .
ALEX:  perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow .
BLAKE:  I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them .
ALEX:  that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad .
BLAKE:  you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking .
ALEX: Good morning . Could I speak with Mr . Willard please ?
BLAKE:  This is he . Who ’ s calling , please ?
ALEX:  This is Chris Emerson speaking .
BLAKE:  Hello , Chris . How can I help you ?
ALEX: Can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum , Miss Thong ?
BLAKE:  Certainly . A letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted . A memorandum is a communication within an organization .
ALEX:  Should we use the layout we use for a letter when we write a memorandum ?
BLAKE:  No , not necessary . Usually we have a set form which is printed . We just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company .
ALEX:  Of course , let me find one for you .
ALEX: Hi , do you have any tickets for the show tonight ?
BLAKE:  Sorry , it ’ s all sold out .
ALEX:  Well , do you have any for tomorrow ?
BLAKE:  We have tickets for the matinee . It starts at 3p . m .
ALEX:  Ok . I ’ ll take it .
BLAKE:  Where would you like to sit ?
ALEX:  Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes .
BLAKE:  Certainly .
ALEX: Lily , I am terribly sorry about this . But we have to put off or cancel tomorrow's meeting .
BLAKE:  Cancelled ? That's just can't happen !
ALEX:  Sorry to say , but nothing can be done . The equipment broke down and can't be fixed till Friday .
BLAKE:  Oh , I hope it be fixed on Friday .
ALEX: Overseas operator , may I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I would like to place a collect call .
ALEX:  Can you tell me the name and number of the person you want ?
BLAKE:  Terry and his number is 4562325 8 .
ALEX:  Please wait a moment . It Will take a few seconds to get through .
ALEX: Would you help me figure out what to do about the office party ?
BLAKE:  I would be happy to help . What would you like me to help with , food or entertainment ?
ALEX:  I would like to help you with both .
BLAKE:  That will work out fine . To make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ?
ALEX:  A dressy party would be fun !
BLAKE:  That will work out fine . Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best ?
ALEX:  We should probably have both .
BLAKE:  Yes , that will work out fine . Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ ?
ALEX:  Maybe we could do both !
BLAKE:  Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details .
ALEX: I can't find the price tag .
BLAKE:  It's right here . $ 100 .
ALEX:  But I heard other stores were having great mark-downs on this item .
BLAKE:  Ours are of really good quality .
ALEX:  I see , please wrap it .
ALEX: Peter , how often do you exercise ?
BLAKE:  Well , I swim and run every day .
ALEX:  Now , tell me , what do you eat ?
BLAKE:  Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .
ALEX:  Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
BLAKE:  Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
ALEX:  What do you drink ?
BLAKE:  Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
ALEX:  What do you drink ?
ALEX: Where can I call a taxi ?
BLAKE:  There's a taxi rank over there , right outside the gate .
ALEX: How did your company's fundraiser go ?
BLAKE:  The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research .
ALEX:  So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ?
BLAKE:  Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars .
ALEX:  Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society .
BLAKE:  In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause .
ALEX: How may I help you today ?
BLAKE:  I need to open a second account .
ALEX:  What kind of account would you like to open ?
BLAKE:  I need another savings account .
ALEX:  Do you have another account with us ?
BLAKE:  I sure do .
ALEX:  Would you like to transfer money from that account into your new one ?
BLAKE:  That ’ s fine .
ALEX:  How much would you like to transfer ?
BLAKE:  Transfer $ 100 .
ALEX:  Give me a moment while I complete your transaction .
BLAKE:  That ’ s fine . Thank you .
ALEX: How about your grades of study ?
BLAKE:  I have been doing quite well . As reach 90 % and Bs reach 100 % . And I ’ Ve received Scholarship two times .

BLAKE:  Yes . To develop my knowledge , I studied Economics , Business Administration and Accountingthrough self-study . Nowadays , I have passed three courses on CPA .
ALEX:  Have you ever been a student cadre ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I used to be the monitor of my class .
ALEX:  Did it affect you much ?
BLAKE:  It ’ s a very important experience for me . First , it improved my organizing ability , and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective . Second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who I like or dislike .
ALEX:  In your spare time , do you have any part time jobs ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I used to work as an assistant lawyer for Tienda Law Office .
ALEX: What kind of a car do you have ?
BLAKE:  An old one .
ALEX:  I know it's old , but what make is it ?
BLAKE:  It's a Chevrolet . Why do you ask ? You going into the car business ?
ALEX:  Nothing like that . My cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him , so he's going to sell it - cheap . It's practically new .
BLAKE:  well I have been thinking about getting a newer car . I can't afford a brand new one .
ALEX:  Would you like to look at my cousin's car ?
BLAKE:  Is it a four-door or a two-door ?
ALEX:  It's a coupe with a vinyl roof .
BLAKE:  Does it have automatic transmission ? .
ALEX:  Yes , and it also has power steering , power brakes , and air conditioning .
BLAKE:  I guess I might take a look at it .
ALEX: What is my prime responsibility in daily work ?
BLAKE:  Your main job is serving the clients and giving them what they want .

BLAKE:  Yes , a coffee would be nice , thank you .
ALEX:  Here you are . Ms . Stevens is ready for you now . I ’ ll show you to her office , right this way .
ALEX: How about your interview ?
BLAKE:  They turned me down .
ALEX:  Why ? You are so excellent .
BLAKE:  I think the only reason is that I was too nervous during the interview and I couldn't express myself the way I wanted to .
ALEX:  What a shame ! You should have showed yourself to them !
BLAKE:  It doesn't matter . I'll try other companies .
ALEX:  I suggest you hunt for a job on the Internet .
BLAKE:  On the Internet ? I've never heard of it .
ALEX:  It's very convenient and it has become popular recently .
BLAKE:  Is that safe ?
ALEX:  Of course , if you log on some standard websites .
BLAKE:  Thank you for your advice . I'll have a try .
ALEX: We are here .
BLAKE:  OK . How much is the fare ?
ALEX:  The total is 45 yuan .
BLAKE:  45 yuan ? It is too much , Are you sure ?
ALEX:  It is 45 yuan on the meter .
BLAKE:  Is there something wrong with your meter ?
ALEX:  No . I am sure about that .
BLAKE:  OK . Could you give me a receipt ?
ALEX:  Yes . This is your receipt .
ALEX: Excuse me . Would you mind trading seats with me ?
BLAKE:  Not at all .
ALEX:  Oh , thank you . That ’ s very kind of you .
BLAKE:  You ’ re welcome . I prefer a window seat .
ALEX:  Oh , you do ? Good . Looking out of the window sometimes scares me . So I prefer to be the man in the middle .
ALEX: Do you plan to further your study ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I have been always learning the Economics on my own . My dream is to get a master's degree in Economics .
ALEX:  If you make every effort to the company , you will have a great chance to attend the on-the-job postgraduate . The tuition fee will be financed by our company .
BLAKE:  Really ? It is amazing . I will apply for a position in your company .
ALEX: Ahem ... uh , sir , I beg your pardon ... Uh , mister , are you waiting to buy a ticket for the movie ?
BLAKE:  What's it look like , lady ? This is the ticket line I'm standing in , isn't it ?
ALEX:  Well , yes , it is , but ...
BLAKE:  So , what's your beef anyway , lady ?
ALEX:  You just cut into line , in front of me and everyone else , that's what ! Go take your place back at the end of the line , like every - one else !
BLAKE:  Oh sure , lady , and fat chance I'd get a ticket before they're sold out . I'm staying right here , understand ? So be a nice lady and butt out !
ALEX:  Just what gives you the right ... ?
BLAKE:  Because I'm no sucker ; only suckers go to the end of the line . It's as simple as that , lady .
ALEX:  Well , you're no gentleman , either .
BLAKE:  Okay , lady , just to show what a gentleman I really am , I'll let you go in front of me . Now , just buy your ticket and shut your trap , will you , lady ?
ALEX:  Whew ! I got the last one . This must be my lucky day !
BLAKE:  What was that you just said ? Last one ... ? Hey , they've closed the ticket window !
ALEX:  Yes , I'm afraid I bought the last ticket , and to think , if you hadn't been such a gentleman . . .
BLAKE:  Lady ! This is unfair ! I've been cheated ! I was in line before you.That should have been my ticket ! Come on , hand it over , lady !
ALEX:  Gentleman ! Hah ! Fat chance ! Hah ! Eat your heart out , sucker ! Hah !

ALEX:  I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine .
BLAKE:  Which tests do you mean ?
ALEX:  You know . Tests like ” how jealous are you ? ” and “ are you a fashion victim ? ”
BLAKE:  Oh , I see . I like to do those tests , too , but I don ’ t take them seriously .
ALEX:  Of course not , but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do . According to the jealousy test , I ’ m quite a jealous type of person . Perhaps I need to control my jealousy .

ALEX: What are we eating for lunch ?
BLAKE:  I have no idea . What about you ?
ALEX:  I kind of want pizza .
BLAKE:  I ate pizza the other day .
ALEX:  So , what do you feel like eating then ?
BLAKE:  How about some burgers ?
ALEX:  I already had a burger yesterday .
BLAKE:  What are we going to do ?
ALEX:  We can just each get what we want to get .
BLAKE:  That sounds like a plan .
ALEX:  Do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ?
BLAKE:  I think they sell both at the cafeteria .
ALEX: Did you bring your certificate for nursing ?
BLAKE:  Yes , here is my Certificate of Nurse .
ALEX:  How about your nursing education ?
BLAKE:  I learnt nursing through theory and practice for 3 years at Hunan Nursing School .
ALEX:  Can you manage English conversation ?
BLAKE:  Yes , pretty well . I have started learning English since primary school .
ALEX: Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ?
BLAKE:  My husband and I have thought about it , but we've decided not to have any . They're just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of Worl
ALEX:  Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ?
BLAKE:  For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share .
ALEX:  Don't you think you would miss having other people around ?
BLAKE:  No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy
ALEX:  If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ?
BLAKE:  That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like
ALEX:  Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?
BLAKE:  I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children !
ALEX: Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses !
BLAKE:  I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
ALEX:  Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .
BLAKE:  So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ?
ALEX:  Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
BLAKE:  Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ?
ALEX:  No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
BLAKE:  You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned .
ALEX: Is Tom in ?
BLAKE:  No , he is at work now .
ALEX:  May I have his office phone number please ?
BLAKE:  Sure . It's 289,1234 .
ALEX: What about driving to Shanghai ?
BLAKE:  Driving ? No way , it's too far .
ALEX:  I just thought it would be an interesting way to see lots of places . How long will it take ?
BLAKE:  Too long , and you do not have much time .
ALEX:  What a pity .
ALEX: Good afternoon . I'll show you to your room .
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX:  Could you tell me which bags are yours ?
BLAKE:  They're over there next to the door . Those three with green tags on them .
ALEX:  Could you wait a moment ? I have to get a trolley . May I see your room key , please ?
BLAKE:  Sure , here it is .
ALEX:  Thank you . Room 402 . You're on the 4th floor . This way , please .
ALEX: Excuse me , sir . Is there anything I can do for you ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I bought the can two days ago , but today I found that is beyond the guarantee period .
ALEX:  Let me see . I am sorry , sir . We will change another one for you . Please wait a moment .
ALEX: Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ?
BLAKE:  The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street .
ALEX:  How long will it take me to get there ?
BLAKE:  It's about a ten-minute walk .
ALEX:  That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .
BLAKE:  Not at all .
ALEX: Excuse me ! Does this bus go to the railway station ?
BLAKE:  No , You're got on the wrong bus . You can take a No . 22 bus at the University station and then transfer to a No . 83 bus at the railway station .
ALEX:  OK ! Thank you very much !
ALEX: I have here our price sheet on a F . O . B . basis . The prices are given without engagement .
BLAKE:  Good , if you ’ ll excuse me , I ’ ll go over the sheet right now .
ALEX:  Take your time .
BLAKE:  I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high .
ALEX:  I ’ m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years .
BLAKE:  We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ?
ALEX:  Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly .
BLAKE:  The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ’ s settle that matter first .
ALEX:  Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent .
BLAKE:  When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent .
ALEX:  How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ?
BLAKE:  To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help .
ALEX:  Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ?
BLAKE:  I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ?
ALEX:  Very well , I will .
ALEX: Excuse me , you look lost.Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station .
ALEX:  Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right .
BLAKE:  Right ? OK , got it .
ALEX:  Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ?
BLAKE:  Next left then right ? OK .
ALEX: I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said .
BLAKE:  I said , ' Do you want me to help you ? '
ALEX:  I'm trying to find a post office .
BLAKE:  Go three blocks and turn right . It's right there .
ALEX:  Should I take the bus ?
BLAKE:  No . It'll only take about five minutes to walk .
ALEX:  Thank you very much .
BLAKE:  Anytime .
ALEX: It says here that you graduated from Beijing Normal University with a major in English Language and Literature .
BLAKE:  Right . Then you may think that I am not fit for this job according to my educational background .
ALEX:  Yes .
BLAKE:  But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate .
ALEX:  So you must be an extravert ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them .
ALEX:  What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ?
BLAKE:  A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment .
ALEX:  Don't you consider it a hard work ?
BLAKE:  Hard but interesting , I think .
ALEX:  Have you any experience as a tourist guide ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University .
ALEX:  Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well .
ALEX: Didn ’ t you punch in this morning , Monica ?
BLAKE:  Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching .
ALEX:  That ’ s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule .
BLAKE:  Do we also need to punch out after work ?
ALEX:  According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day .
BLAKE:  How about the lunch break , Lucy ?
ALEX:  From 11 thirty to 1 o ’ clock .
BLAKE:  May I ask whether we need to work overtime ?
ALEX:  Sometimes , but not quite often .
ALEX: This needs dry-cleaning.Can you remove this stain without harming the fabric ?
BLAKE:  Let me see . We ’ ll try , but I ’ m not sure that we can remove it .
ALEX:  Ok , then . We ’ ll I ’ d also like to have this pressed .
BLAKE:  Any starch ?
ALEX:  No starch .
ALEX: What's the problem ?
BLAKE:  I have a laceration on my left forearm .
ALEX:  Let me have a look . How did this happen ?
BLAKE:  I got hit by a car in an accident .
ALEX:  Was there much bleeding afterward ?
BLAKE:  No , not much .
ALEX:  Well , this doesn't look too serious . Nurse , could you please get me a suture set ?
BLAKE:  Will I need stitches ?
ALEX:  Yes . Three , I think . It wont ' be too painful . Alright , we're done . That wasn't so bad , was it ?
BLAKE:  No , not really .
ALEX:  You're lucky there was no lasting damage . I'll set up an appointment for you to come back in five days . We'll take those stitches out then . So long .
BLAKE:  Thank you , doctor . Bye .
ALEX: What time is it ?
BLAKE:  Ten to nine .
ALEX:  Your watch is ten minutes slow . So it's should be nine sharp . I'm gonna be late again . What will be my excuse this time ? It should be set the alarm for seven thirty .
BLAKE:  Don't cry over spilled milk , Fred ? Could you stay with me a few minutes ?
ALEX:  What ? Why ? What's wrong with you ?
BLAKE:  I just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking.It ' s so lonely and boring . My sickness makes it worse . When will I recover ?
ALEX:  You will be fine in the couple of month , just be patient . I've got to woke now , I'll be late .
BLAKE:  You only care about your work .
ALEX:  Sorry , baby , you are everything to me . all I do just for our family .
BLAKE:  Stay just a few minutes longer , OK ?
ALEX:  OK , I'll leave at 9:15 , Is that all right ?
BLAKE:  Yes .
ALEX:  I'll spent more time with you in the future , Dina .
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX: Canton Hotel .
BLAKE:  I'd like to reserve a double room . I will be arriving next Monday , the 12th . My name is Wilson .
ALEX:  A double room for the 12th ? The name is Wilson ?
BLAKE:  Yes , that's right .
ALEX:  How long will you be staying ?
BLAKE:  Three or four days , perhaps longer .
ALEX:  Very good , sir . We will be expecting you next Monday , the 12th .
ALEX: How is the result of your lab test ?
BLAKE:  When it comes to that , I have a lot to say .
ALEX:  Then say it .
BLAKE:  When I went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests , I tried to keep a poker face even though I was scared to death . Then you guess what he said .
ALEX:  That ’ s just what I want to know .
BLAKE:  He told me the tests were negative and there was nothing wrong with me .
ALEX: Could you tell me something about your family ?
BLAKE:  OK . There are five people in my family , Father , mother , elder brother , younger sister and I .
ALEX:  Are your brother and sister still in school ?
BLAKE:  My brother has found his job and my sister is still in college .
ALEX:  What does your father do ?
BLAKE:  My father is a middle school teacher .
ALEX:  What about your mother ?
BLAKE:  My mother is a housewife .
ALEX:  Are you married ?
BLAKE:  I am not married yet and I live alone now .
ALEX:  Do you need to support your family ?
BLAKE:  No , my father and brother are doing that .
ALEX:  Have you finished school ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I have already graduated .
ALEX: I'm in heaven ! A Whirlpool dryer !
BLAKE:  I love them , too . Let's move into the kitchen . Wait until you see the refrigerator .
ALEX:  This is too good to be true .
BLAKE:  And the stove is brand new . You know how to use a gas stove , right ?
ALEX:  Yes . We've lived in Taiwan for a while . I had a gas stove in the States , too .
BLAKE:  It's better for cooking Chinese food . Well , what do you think ?
ALEX:  We love it . But we'd like to know about the neighbors .
ALEX: How's your new car ?
BLAKE:  Perfect ! Couldn't be better .
ALEX:  You made a good choice , then ?
BLAKE:  It's just what I want .
ALEX:  No regrets ?
BLAKE:  I am really pleased with it .
ALEX:  I am glad you are happy .
BLAKE:  It's super .
ALEX: Good afternoon , Sir . You're here to see about a Temporary Loan , right ? The loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets . Is that what you require ?
BLAKE:  Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ?
ALEX:  Well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period .
BLAKE:  Is there any flexibility on that ?
ALEX:  Unfortunately , not .
BLAKE:  OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan .
ALEX:  Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away .
ALEX: Mr . Wang , I've had scheduled for your two days stay in Shanghai . You can make some changes if it does not suit you .
BLAKE:  All right . Please read it to me .
ALEX:  On Friday morning , Mr . Wang , the director of Shanghai Research Institute , will visit you at the hotel . In the afternoon , you will discuss some problems with Mr . Yang , vice manager of computer corporation .
BLAKE:  Very good .
ALEX:  On Saturday , you'll leave the hotel for sightseeing . Miss Lu will be your guide .
BLAKE:  Oh , that's great .
ALEX: Hi , I would like to return this TV .
BLAKE:  Sure , do you have the receipt ?
ALEX:  Yeah here you go . Actually I also want to return this keyboard .
BLAKE:  Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ?
ALEX:  The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear .
BLAKE:  I see , and what about the keyboard ?
ALEX:  I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work .
BLAKE:  I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages .
ALEX:  Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways .
ALEX: There are so many people that the tickets are all sold out !
BLAKE:  Luckily we got the last two .
ALEX:  Look , Danny . The Four Great Inventions !
BLAKE:  Gunpowder , compass , the paper making , and the printing .
ALEX:  I really admire those who made such great inventions !
BLAKE:  May , I don't see why they are great . They are just simple things .
ALEX:  They look simple today . But they were milestones in their times .
BLAKE:  Milestones ? May , you must be kidding .
ALEX:  Just think Bill Gates , those inventions are as important as the windows system .
BLAKE:  Well , I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them .
ALEX:  No , quite the contrary .
BLAKE:  Why ? Didn't you say that they were milestones ?
ALEX:  Yes , but they went to the public without any patent protection .
BLAKE:  Well , their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates .
ALEX: What can I do for you ?
BLAKE:  I need some medicine .
ALEX:  For whom ?
BLAKE:  My wife . She suffers from a bad cold .
ALEX:  What symptoms does she have ?
BLAKE:  Fever and a bad cough .
ALEX:  I see . Don't worry , just a common cold .
BLAKE:  What kind of medicine does she need ?
ALEX:  Patulin will be enough .
BLAKE:  How many pills for each time ?
ALEX:  Nine pills per day , and three pills after each meal .
BLAKE:  Thank you very much .
ALEX:  It's my pleasure .
ALEX: Do you believe in god ?
BLAKE:  Not at all . I ’ m an agnostic . do you ?
ALEX:  I ’ m not sure . Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ?
BLAKE:  I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one .
ALEX:  I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet .
BLAKE:  I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong .
ALEX:  For example ?
BLAKE:  Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics .
ALEX:  Yes . Such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs .
ALEX: Didn't you say your friend was American ? Where is she going on her honeymoon ?
BLAKE:  They're going skiing in Colorado .
ALEX:  What a coincidence ! These pajamas would be perfect to take along on the honeymoon !
BLAKE:  You're probably right . Oh , what the heck ! I'll take it all ... in maroon , like you said .
ALEX: What a terrible house !
BLAKE:  I'm sick of it , too .
ALEX:  The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart .
BLAKE:  It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out .
ALEX:  Sure .
ALEX: Hello !
BLAKE:  Is that Sue ?
ALEX:  Speaking .
BLAKE:  A.This is George .
ALEX:  Hello , George.What ' s up ?
ALEX: This website offers very convenient air tickets booking service . It is quick and accurate .

ALEX:  Yes . Can I see that T-shirt on the top shelf please ?
BLAKE:  Sure . Here it is .
ALEX:  How much does it cost ?
BLAKE:  50 dollars .
ALEX:  50 dollars . That's too much .
BLAKE:  How about this one ? It's on sale for only 35 dollars .
ALEX:  I don't like that one .
BLAKE:  How about the one next to the black gloves ? It's very similar to the one you like .
ALEX:  That's nice . How much is it ?
BLAKE:  30 dollars .
ALEX:  That'll be fine .
BLAKE:  Is this color OK , or would you like a different color ?
ALEX:  That blue one's fine .
BLAKE:  Do you need any more of these shirts ?
ALEX:  Yes .
BLAKE:  How many do you want ?
ALEX:  I'll take two more , a red one and a white one .
ALEX: Hello , this is Li Bo speaking .
BLAKE:  Hi , I am Liu Ming . I am calling to tell you that I have got the job .
ALEX:  Oh , that is wonderful . Congratulations !
BLAKE:  I really feel grateful to you for your reference . They have mentioned this in the job interview .
ALEX:  Don't mention it . I think that is because you have right qualifications and nice personality .
BLAKE:  Thanks again . I will start on next Monday . I am sure I will have good performance .
ALEX:  I agree .
ALEX: I am a student in Cambridge University . I read your ad , I want to know something more about your room , please ?
BLAKE:  It's a big bedroom with a drawing room , facing a beautiful wood .
ALEX:  Is there a bathroom ?
BLAKE:  No , but there is one downstairs , which my daughter used some years ago .
ALEX:  It sounds good . Could I go and see it myself ?
BLAKE:  Certainly , you're welcome anytime .
ALEX:  See you later !
BLAKE:  ( after a while ) Good afternoon , Mrs . Smith . I called you just now .
ALEX:  Welcome ! Come in , please !
BLAKE:  Yes .
ALEX:  This way please . Your room is upstairs ... Here it is .
BLAKE:  Wonderful ! A modest , comfortable room . Ah , a beautiful window , through which I can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . How nice !

BLAKE:  Excellent ! I like it ! When can I move in ?
ALEX:  Anytime you like .
BLAKE:  OK .
ALEX: Hello , this is Dunlin . May I speak to Mrs Smith ?
BLAKE:  This is Mrs Smith . Can I help you ?

BLAKE:  No , nothing . It's thoughtful of you to call me again .
ALEX:  Thank you . Please call me at any time if you have any questions .
BLAKE:  Ok , I will . Do you have any question ?
ALEX:  No , thank you . Goodbye .
BLAKE:  Goodbye .
ALEX: Hi there . Welcome to Lincoln Corporate Services . How can we help ?
BLAKE:  Hi . I was wondering what kind of fixed asset loans you have ? Do you have Fixed Asset Loans ?
ALEX:  Yes , we do . You'll go through the acceptance application , then a first review , then an evaluation and examination and finally get approval . Why don't you read through this brochure ? It outlines all of the important aspects of the loan , the terms and conditions , etc .
BLAKE:  That's a good idea , to familiarise myself with it . Then , I'll be back if we decide to go ahead .
ALEX: There are many art craft items in this shop . I suggest you take your time , and you might find something you like .
BLAKE:  That's what I am going to do .
ALEX:  If you have any problem , please come to me .
BLAKE:  I surely will . How much is this wood carving ?
ALEX:  You are an expert on it . That wood carving is very rare . But I'm so sorry . that is not for sell .
BLAKE:  That's OK . Is anything else recommended ?
ALEX:  Do you have any special request ?
BLAKE:  I'd like to see some traditional arts .
ALEX:  So that means you are shopping for presents ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends .
ALEX:  Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle .
BLAKE:  Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut .
ALEX:  I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best .
BLAKE:  You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale .
ALEX:  As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country .
BLAKE:  Wow , you are the expert on it .
ALEX: Operator . Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  I'd like to make a person-to-person call to Beijing , China . The number is 2135367 8 , and I want to speak to Mr . Zhang .
ALEX:  To Mr . Zhang in at 2135-3678 ?
BLAKE:  Yes , that's right .
ALEX:  May I have your name and telephone number ?
BLAKE:  My name is Luo Gang , and the phone number is 513-3284 .
ALEX:  Mr . Luo , will you hold the line , please - - - Mr . Luo , there is no Zhang at that number . Will you check the number again , please ?
BLAKE:  What the number I gave you , operator ?
ALEX:  It's 2135-3678 .
BLAKE:  Oh , I'm sorry . should have been 2135-3668 , not 3678 . I've given you a wrong number .
ALEX:  Are you sure this time ?
BLAKE:  Yes .
ALEX:  OK . Let me try again .
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX: Are there any special requirements on the project ? And shall we talk around it in details ?
BLAKE:  Yes , there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it . Besides , you see , in recent years , we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness .
ALEX:  That's a good idea . We can improve our technology to meet your special need .
BLAKE:  And please let white color dominate .
ALEX:  OK ! I've noted it down . And any others ?
BLAKE:  Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city .
ALEX:  I'll tell them .
BLAKE:  Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor .
ALEX:  Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery .
BLAKE:  Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you .
ALEX:  I think so . Bye !
BLAKE:  Bye !
ALEX: Mr . Black , I ' d like to take some time off . I ' Ve been feeling exhausted these days .
BLAKE:  That's no problem . Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ?
ALEX:  Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off .
BLAKE:  That's long leave . How's your project coming along ?
ALEX:  The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on .
BLAKE:  Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave .
ALEX:  Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients .
BLAKE:  Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed .
ALEX:  I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black .
ALEX: Did you ever get a parking ticket ?
BLAKE:  Only a few .
ALEX:  What's a few ?
BLAKE:  I've gotten six , I think .
ALEX:  Did you pay your fines ?
BLAKE:  Of course I have .
ALEX:  How much are the parking tickets ?
BLAKE:  I think they're $ 130 .
ALEX:  That's expensive .
BLAKE:  I just got a parking ticket .
ALEX:  You should probably pay the fine soon .
BLAKE:  I'm going to pay it today .
ALEX: Are you doing anything right now , Diana ?
BLAKE:  I am typing a report for the moment , Mr . Robbins . Anything I need to do ?
ALEX:  Will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter ?
BLAKE:  Is it urgent ?
ALEX:  Yes , this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5 . It's about a contract .
BLAKE:  Ok , I am coming .
ALEX:  Please take a seat , Diana . Have you got your spare pens and pencils ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I have this time . But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ?
ALEX:  No , I ’ d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter .
BLAKE:  All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments .
ALEX:  Of course , Diana . You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it .
BLAKE:  Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ?
ALEX:  Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list .
BLAKE:  You want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ?
ALEX:  Right . And the last thing , we are going to clean the files out tomorrow . Now let's begin .
ALEX: You're finally here ! What took so long ?
BLAKE:  I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection .
ALEX:  It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
BLAKE:  I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest .
ALEX:  perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work .
BLAKE:  I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good .
ALEX:  It would be better for the environment , too .
BLAKE:  I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city .
ALEX:  Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well .
BLAKE:  The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car .
ALEX:  Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides .
BLAKE:  That's true . I could certainly use the exercise !
ALEX:  So , are you going to quit driving to work then ?
BLAKE:  Yes , it's not good for me or for the environment .
ALEX: That's really convenient . We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though .
BLAKE:  I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand .
ALEX:  That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out .
BLAKE:  Sure , for at least three thousand per month .
ALEX:  That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for .
BLAKE:  I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent .
ALEX: Hello . I sent out my laundry yesterday.Aren ' t they ready ?
BLAKE:  They'll be ready by this afternoon .
ALEX:  Oh , no ! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning .
BLAKE:  Is that right ? We're very sorry .
ALEX:  I thought it was " the same day " service.Anyway , please do hurry .
BLAKE:  I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock .
ALEX:  Well , then , would you send it to Japan , please ?
BLAKE:  Yes , we'll do so .
ALEX: Hello , welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ?
BLAKE:  I want to effect payment under an L / C today .
ALEX:  No problem . OK ... just checking for you . Ah , I'm afraid there aren't enough funds in your account to cover this transaction . What you can do is buy some US dollars , using local currency and we can credit your account with that amount .
BLAKE:  That seems alright . What's the exchange rate like today ? Good or bad ?
ALEX:  It's not too bad today , actually . 828.23 .
ALEX: How can I help you , sir ?
BLAKE:  I am here to have a discussion on your company's investment issue .
ALEX:  Sorry , could you tell me your name ?
BLAKE:  I am James Pond from FAM Company and I am here to discuss it with Nova .
ALEX:  Do you have an appointment ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I did it yesterday . Our meeting should be 2 pm .
ALEX:  I guess she forgot your meeting . She is attending an important meeting in the company . Will you have a seat ? May I leave a memo for her ?
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX:  She will be back soon .
ALEX: Excuse me . Would you please make a suit with this material ?
BLAKE:  Sure . May I take your measurements ?
ALEX:  Please don't make it too tight . This is for autumn wear , so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath .
BLAKE:  I see , sir . Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th , that's in a week's time ?
ALEX:  The 10th ? I'm sorry , but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th . Could you have the suit ready by the 8th , or at the latest , the 9th ?
BLAKE:  Well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . But in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . How about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ?
ALEX:  That's fine , thank you .
ALEX: Good morning everyone . Thank you for attending the meeting today . I'm sure you all have a copy of the agenda . So let's get started with the first issue .
BLAKE:  We're here today to present to you the results of our marketing research regarding the consumer behavior .
ALEX:  I would like to begin by introducing our foreign guests to our stuff on your left ( right ) , we have Mr . Brown , who is Vice President of Sales . Next to him is Ms . Arts , Director of Marketing for the Atlas Company . In the back row is Dr . Barolo , who is visiting from Italy . Thank you all for coming .
BLAKE:  I am glad to see everyone is here and on time . Let's get started ! Susan , toss out some of your ideas .
ALEX: It seems that many boys are fighting there .
BLAKE:  Break it up ! I will not permit fighting in this campus .
ALEX: the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again !
BLAKE:  exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment .
ALEX:  on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
BLAKE:  as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health .
ALEX:  I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse
BLAKE:  what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?
ALEX:  it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .
BLAKE:  I see , so it's similar to global warming ?
ALEX:  they're related to one another , yes .
BLAKE:  I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .
ALEX:  people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .
BLAKE:  people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .
ALEX:  I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place .
ALEX: Would you like some cookies ? I just made them .
BLAKE:  Thank you . Yes , I would .
ALEX:  These are chocolate , and those are almond-flavored .
BLAKE:  I guess I'll try a chocolate one first.Mmmm ... this is delicious.Are they hard to make ?
ALEX:  No , they're really quite easy . Wait a minute , I've got the recipe right here.See ... these are the ingredients , and then you just follow the directions .
BLAKE:  That does look easy . I think I'll make some tonight .
ALEX: Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  I'd like to buy a ticket to Casablanca on flight US125 tomorrow .
ALEX:  Hold on , plese.It will take off at 14:00 tomorrow.The price is $ 110 .
BLAKE:  Well , I want to stay under $ 100 .
ALEX:  I am sorry Sir . We won't give any discount in busy seasons.The price is the same .
ALEX: How do you use an ATM card , Billy ?
BLAKE:  It ’ s easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers .
ALEX:  Oh yes . I ’ Ve got it written down here . Just a minute .
BLAKE:  You really shouldn ’ t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like .
ALEX:  Ok , I ’ Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don ’ t I ?
BLAKE:  Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want .
ALEX:  I can just enter the amount using the key , right ?
BLAKE:  That ’ s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money .
ALEX:  These machines aren ’ t very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk .
ALEX: Hello , is Jennifer in ?
BLAKE:  I am sorry , you have the wrong number .
ALEX:  Oh , I am really sorry .
ALEX: Can you give me a hand with the dishes ?
BLAKE:  Sure . Should I wash or dry ?
ALEX:  I wash and you'll dry .
BLAKE:  OK . Let's do it .
ALEX: Excuse me , do you have the latest issue of Newsworld ?
BLAKE:  Yes , this week's issue just came in . Here it is .
ALEX:  How about Music Madness ?
BLAKE:  Let me check ... yes , we got the October issue a few days ago . It's on that shelf over there .
ALEX:  Okay , I'll take these two magazines and a copy of Today's Post .
ALEX: Good afternoon , Miss . What can I do for you ?
BLAKE:  Could you tell me my account balance ? My account number is ...
ALEX:  Just a moment , please . Your name ?
BLAKE:  Emily Smith .
ALEX:  Here is your balance .
BLAKE:  Thank you . I want to make a withdrawal of 150 dollars .
ALEX:  Here you go , Miss .
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX: We will go to Luoyang for a vacation next month .
BLAKE:  How long will you stay there ?
ALEX:  About one week .
BLAKE:  Where will you live during the vacation .
ALEX:  In the hotel .
BLAKE:  Have you made a reservation ?
ALEX:  Yes , we have .
BLAKE:  That's OK .
ALEX: You look great ! How do you stay in such good shape ?
BLAKE:  Well , I go jogging every morning , eat a healthful diet and work out in a gymnasium twice a week .
ALEX:  Wow , it sounds like a lot of work . I guess I'm too lazy to do all that .
ALEX: Bob from accounting is on the line . Do you want to speak with him ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I need to talk to him .
ALEX:  I'll put the call through then .
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX: I want to send some money to Australia . Could you handle it for me ?
BLAKE:  Yes , madam , how much would you like to remit ?
ALEX:  2,000 AD $ .
BLAKE:  Which would you like to remit , by mail or by cable ?
ALEX:  What is the difference between them ?
BLAKE:  The cable will take less time for your account , in the meantime , the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one .
ALEX:  Well , I think the cable is better .
BLAKE:  OK , please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary , your name and telephone .
ALEX:  All right . Here you are .
BLAKE:  Everything is OK . The commission is 50 yuan .
ALEX:  Here you are . Thanks a lot .
ALEX: Kate , can we change the channel ?
BLAKE:  Why ?
ALEX:  This channel has so many advertisements , and it doesn't have any good TV programs .
BLAKE:  OK . You can change it .
ALEX:  What about this one ? Do you like this program ?
BLAKE:  No , I think it is very boring . Can you change it to Channel Twelve , please ?
ALEX:  Yes . Oh , it's a talk show .
BLAKE:  Yeah , it's very funny . Have you ever watched it before ?
ALEX:  No , I haven't . This is my first time to watch it .
BLAKE:  I'm sure you will like it .
ALEX: Excuse me , is there any summer resort around the town ?
BLAKE:  As far as I know , the nearest one is next to the Willdon .
ALEX:  It doesn't matter . I just want to have a relax and I don't care how far it is . Can you tell me how to get there ?
BLAKE:  Yes , take the greyhound bus . It will lead you directly there .
ALEX:  Thanks a billion .
ALEX: Every honored guests , welcome to Hang Thou . Now we are visiting Tiger-running Spring .
BLAKE:  How can we relate tiger to this spot , Miss Zhang ?
ALEX:  Its name originates from a legend that two tigers run here and made a hole , and then a spring gushed out from it .
BLAKE:  How ignorant I am !
ALEX:  The Longing Tea and the Tiger-running Spring water are always considered as the “ Two Wonders in West Lake . ”
BLAKE:  I know that tea . It smells fragrant .
ALEX:  That's right . All my guests , attention please . We will have half an hour to visit the spring and take photos . And next spot will be the Moon Reflected in Three Pools .
BLAKE:  Janice , David , come here . We take some photos here . I can't imagine how beautiful it is !
ALEX: Can I give you a hand ?
BLAKE:  Thanks .
ALEX: You have been staying at home for several days . Would you like to hang out with me ?
BLAKE:  No problem . Wait a moment .
ALEX: May I speak to Mr . Baker ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m afraid he's not in .
ALEX:  Will you ask him to call me collect when he ’ s back ?
BLAKE:  Certainly . May I ask who ’ s calling , please ?
ALEX:  Yes , this is Cindy Wang of A & B Trading Company in New York .
ALEX: I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too title .
BLAKE:  I'm not sure I can't agree , dan
ALEX:  Why not ?
BLAKE:  Surely , there are other ways to save money .
ALEX:  What are you talking about , we tried everything !
ALEX: I've got some great news for you !
BLAKE:  Did you get the position you wanted ?
ALEX:  Yes , I'll be promoted to department manager .
BLAKE:  I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations !
ALEX:  Thank you . Actually , I could not believe it at first . You know , there're so many outstanding people in our company . Many of them are qualified to fill that position .
BLAKE:  Sure , but you really did great and outperformed the others . You deserved it !
ALEX:  Thank you very much .
ALEX: Thank you for a lovely day . I really enjoyed it .
BLAKE:  It was nice to have you with us .
ALEX:  Thank you for the picnic too . It was supper .
BLAKE:  Not at all . It was a pleasure . Perhaps you will come out with us again while you are here .
ALEX:  Yes , I'd love to . Thanks again . Goodbye .
BLAKE:  Goodbye .
ALEX: Hi , Customer Service Desk . What can I do for you today , sir ?
BLAKE:  Good morning . I bought this vacuum here a few months ago . It doesn ’ t work now . Can I return it or get it fixed ?
ALEX:  Do you have your receipt with you ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I do .
ALEX:  When did you buy it from our store ?
BLAKE:  Four months ago .
ALEX:  I ’ m sorry . You can ’ t return it because too much time has passed since you purchased it . In order to receive a refund , you must return merchandise to the store within 90 days of purchase .
BLAKE:  But the direction book says I will get one-year warranty .
ALEX:  Yes , I know . After 90 days , you need to call the company that manufactured the vacuum to fix it because it ’ s still under their warranty . Their phone number should be in the direction book that came with your vacuum .
BLAKE:  Okay . I understand . I ’ ll call the Customer Service Office of the manufacturer . Thank you .
ALEX:  You ’ re welcome .
ALEX: Excuse me , I'm looking for the Alands Morrissette album Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie .

BLAKE:  Yes , it's right over here .

ALEX:  By American express , if that's ok .

BLAKE:  You have quite a range , haven't you ? I would like to see some other styles .
ALEX: Sorry , I overslept . My clock didn't go off this morning .
BLAKE:  Again ?
ALEX:  That's right , even though I did set the alarm last night .
BLAKE:  Your clock never works . Perhaps you should buy a new one .
ALEX:  Well , if it breaks down again tomorrow , I'll definitely buy a new one .
ALEX: I was really glad to hear about your award . Congratulations !

BLAKE:  They ’ re in that drawer .
ALEX:  OK , I know . Would you please help me clean the kitchen ?
BLAKE:  No problem .
ALEX: Oh hi , Linda , this is Todd .
BLAKE:  Yes , Todd , how nice to hear your voice !
ALEX:  Linda , I just wanted to say that I had a wonderful evening with you last Friday .

BLAKE:  Thanks . Good-bye .
ALEX: Do you want to know what really motivates Vince to be nice to me ?
BLAKE:  OK . What ?
ALEX:  It isn't gratitude . It's fear . Vince is afraid I'll jump to a competitor .
BLAKE:  You wouldn't do that . Would you ?
ALEX:  I might . Vince knows he needs to keep me happy .
BLAKE:  What about your accounts ?
ALEX: May I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I am wondering if I can join the sightseeing tour in your hotel .
ALEX:  Of course . How many people are there in your party ?
BLAKE:  4 persons altogether .
ALEX:  OK , I will arrange it for you .
BLAKE:  Thank you . Put the charge on my bills , please .
ALEX: Good afternoon . Is this the Roley Hotel ?
BLAKE:  Yes , madam . May I help you ?
ALEX:  Yes . I ’ m calling from Westwood and Westwood Attorneys . I need to make a reservation for Mr . Alex Brent .
BLAKE:  Fine , madam . When will Mr . Brent be arriving , and how many nights will he be staying ?
ALEX: it's a lovely day out today , isn't it ?
BLAKE:  it's beautiful . Enjoy it while it lasts . It's supposed to get cold tomorrow .
ALEX:  what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
BLAKE:  it's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain .
ALEX:  that doesn't sound pretty .
BLAKE:  do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
ALEX:  well , I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends .
BLAKE:  you might want to change your plans . With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery .
ALEX:  I suppose I should . I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . Do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
BLAKE:  I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
ALEX:  if you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !
BLAKE:  if that happens , then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
ALEX:  that sounds like fun .
BLAKE:  hey , look outside ! It's started to drizzle !
ALEX:  English weather is even more predictable than I had previously thought .
ALEX: Can you tell me what's included in your warranty ?
BLAKE:  Certainly . The product has a two-year guarantee . If it breaks down during that period we offer a replacement unit completely free of charge . Our products are very reliable but we recommend you take out an extended warranty . This covers you for a further two years .
ALEX:  I see . What does that include ?
BLAKE:  It covers all parts and labour , except for normal wear and tear of course .
ALEX:  What sort of response time do you guarantee ?
BLAKE:  Our engineers are on call 24 hours a day . We guarantee someone will be with you within four hours , but in practice it's often much sooner .
ALEX:  Are there any exclusions ?
BLAKE:  Not really . It's a very comprehensive warranty . I ’ ll put a copy in the post to you and you can read through the small print .
ALEX: Do you have any particular conditions that you would like our company to take into consideration ?
BLAKE:  No , nothing in particular .
ALEX:  All right . If we decide to hire you , we'd pay you two thousand and five hundred yuan a month at the start . You can have Saturdays and Sundays off . Besides , you may have a paid month holiday every year . How do you think about it ?
BLAKE:  As regards salary , I leave it to you to decide after experience of capacity .
ALEX:  Well , we'll give you our decision in a couple of days . It's a pleasure to talk to you , Mr . Liu .
BLAKE:  Thank you , Mr . White . I really appreciate your assistance .
ALEX: Did you ever buy food from the snack stands near our hotel ?
BLAKE:  Yes , several times .
ALEX:  How do you like them ?
BLAKE:  Not bad .
ALEX:  I always have the temptation to eat something there .
BLAKE:  Then , why didn't you do that ?
ALEX:  I don't know how much we can trust them . Do you have any ideas ?
BLAKE:  Some of them , I think , are not good .
ALEX:  It doesn't taste good ?
BLAKE:  No , I mean some of them are not clean enough .
ALEX:  That's my greatest concern . But how can you tell which one is clean ?
BLAKE:  I judge by appearances .
ALEX:  I got it . I think it's worth trying .
BLAKE:  It certainly is .
ALEX:  I'd like to try some kebab , roasted squid , and many different appealing things .
BLAKE:  Don't try everything at one time , please .
ALEX:  I see . Thank you .
ALEX: I need my minibar restocked .
BLAKE:  Everything is gone , sir ?
ALEX:  There's not a drop left of anything .
BLAKE:  Is there anything in particular you want ?
ALEX:  Yes , the Perrier and the Jim Beam hit the spot . Let me have three more of each .
BLAKE:  Got it . Anything else ?
ALEX:  I really liked the apples . Bring me a couple of apples , please .
BLAKE:  Not a problem . Anything else ?
ALEX:  Oh , yes , one more thing
BLAKE:  Someone will be up shortly with your order , sir .
ALEX: I will travel to Southeast Asia this summer , so I need to exchange some US dollars . Can I get the foreign currency at any bank ?
BLAKE:  I don't think you can . In China , our currency is not freely convertible yet .
ALEX:  Do you mean there is no way to get any foreign money ?
BLAKE:  No . You can go to the Bank of China to exchange some US dollars at the current exchange rate of the day you exchange them . The maximum amount you can exchange is $ 2,000 .
ALEX:  Only $ 2,000 ? Are there any other ways to get the money exchanged ?
BLAKE:  The only official way is to go to Bank of China .
ALEX:  I'd better take more dollars with me . It seems that I need to borrow some from my friends .
ALEX: can you squeeze me in sometime today ?
BLAKE:  That ’ s a big order , Jane . I am really swamped .
ALEX:  I know what you ’ re saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy .
BLAKE:  Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? It won ’ t take more than a half hour , will it ?
ALEX: You seem to be upset . What ’ s eating you ?
BLAKE:  It ’ s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves
ALEX:  Dick ? How come ? He used to be as meek as a lamb .
BLAKE:  Yes , he used to be . But now he ’ s drifting off track .
ALEX:  He must have been in bad company , or he wouldn ’ t be off the beans .
ALEX: Bring me some toast , please .
BLAKE:  Would you like butter or jam on your toast or do you just want it plain ?
ALEX:  Spread some jam , please .
BLAKE:  Anything to drink ?
ALEX:  Black coffee is fine .
ALEX: Peter , it's time to get up .
BLAKE:  Ten more minutes , mom .
ALEX:  What time is it now ?
BLAKE:  It's already 3 8 o'clock .
ALEX:  Well , honey , wake up , or you'll be late for school .
ALEX: shall we dance ?
BLAKE:  sure . i suppose you dance much .
ALEX:  oh . no as a matter of fact , i haven't danced for a long time .
BLAKE:  but i can see you dance wonderfully well .
ALEX:  thanks for flattering me 。 i think you dance much right ?
BLAKE:  no , just occasionally
ALEX:  oh , i like this music very much , let's tango .
BLAKE:  i'm afraid i can't dance well .
ALEX: Well , it's illegal to bring food and drinks into the theater .
BLAKE:  Too bad . I did anyway .
ALEX:  No wonder you brought such a big bag today .
BLAKE:  I brought Strawberry Sticks . See ?
ALEX:  Those are the ones that are pre-dipped in sweet coating !
BLAKE:  Yep . And there's real strawberry chunks in the coating .
ALEX: I think that you look very cute today .
BLAKE:  Is that right ? This is a brand new outfit .
ALEX:  What store did you get it from ?
BLAKE:  I went to Macy's and picked it out .
ALEX:  I love your outfit right now .
BLAKE:  Well , I think you look nice today too .
ALEX:  Thanks . I found these new shoes earlier at the store .
BLAKE:  I think that those are some really nice shoes . What kind are they ?
ALEX:  These are Chucks .
BLAKE:  Your shoes look really nice . How much did you get them for ?
ALEX:  They only cost me about forty dollars .
BLAKE:  I'm going to go get a pair for myself .
ALEX: What can I do for you ?
BLAKE:  I'd like to be waken up tomorrow morning .
ALEX:  OK sir . At what time ?
BLAKE:  Well , how long is it from here to the train station ?
ALEX:  If you take a taxi , it will be 20 minutes .
BLAKE:  Then please wake me up at 7 : OO.Thank you .
ALEX: Ah , ah , ah ...
BLAKE:  All right , Bill.Here ' s your daily exercise schedule . You are to jog before breakfast .
ALEX:  Jog ?
BLAKE:  Then , you are to walk to work .
ALEX:  Walk ?
BLAKE:  Thirty minutes in gym at lunch time .
ALEX:  Oh no .
BLAKE:  Use the stairs , never the elevator .
ALEX:  Oh , dear .
BLAKE:  And three times a week , you can either swim , play racketball , or hand ball .
ALEX:  Oh no .
BLAKE:  OK , you can stop now.It ' s time for the dance class .
ALEX:  Dance class ! I don't know how .
BLAKE:  You will .
ALEX:  Oh ...
ALEX: I have a reservation . My name is John Sandals .
BLAKE:  May I see your ID , please , Mr . Sandals ?
ALEX:  Certainly . Here it is .
BLAKE:  Thank you . Do you have a credit card , Mr . Sandals ?
ALEX:  Yes , I do . Do you accept American Express ?
BLAKE:  Sorry , sir , just VISA or MasterCard .
ALEX:  Okay . Here's my VISA card .
BLAKE:  Okay . You're in room 507 . It's a single queen-size bed , spacious , and nonsmoking . Is that suitable ?
ALEX:  Yes , it sounds like everything I expected .
BLAKE:  Here's your key , sir . If you need anything , just dial 0 on your room phone .
ALEX: Sandy , can you help me contact these people ?
BLAKE:  Sure , what do you want me to tell them ?
ALEX:  Well , I need to confirm the time of their classes .
BLAKE:  Ok , where can I find their telephone number ?
ALEX:  They are all listed here on this sheet of paper .
BLAKE:  Is it their home , office or cell phone numbers ?
ALEX:  Unless it ’ s marked differently , it ’ s their home numbers .
BLAKE:  Alright . What if I can ’ t get a hold of them by phone ?
ALEX:  Then , you should e-mail them with the information .
BLAKE:  Where can I find their e-mail addresses ?
ALEX:  They should have then listed on their resumes .
BLAKE:  And if there aren ’ t any e-mail addresses ?
ALEX:  Then send them a SMS on their cell phone .
BLAKE:  Ok . That sounds easy enough . Have you called any of them yet ?
ALEX:  Yes . I called the first three people on the list , but they didn ’ t pick up .
BLAKE:  Did you leave a voice message ?
ALEX:  I left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list .
BLAKE:  I see . What did you tell her ?
ALEX:  I told her that she should call me back at my office number .
BLAKE:  Ok , so , maybe I should call her again .
ALEX:  Yes , that sounds like a good idea . She might not get the other message in time .
BLAKE:  One more question . It looks like some of these numbers are long-distance . Do you have a calling card that I can use to get through to them ?
ALEX:  Sure . You can use this one . The pin number is written on the back of the card .
BLAKE:  Alright . Thanks a lot . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll take care of it .
ALEX:  Great work . I ’ m off for the weekend ! See you on Monday .

BLAKE:  Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ?
ALEX:  Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ?
BLAKE:  I surely do . They must have had advanced machine in ancient China to do that .
ALEX:  No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .
BLAKE:  Unbelievable ! I could never do that .
ALEX: Good morning . Can I see Mr Jackson , please ?
BLAKE:  Well . Have you got his permission ?
ALEX:  Yes . We have an appointment at eight o ’ clock .
BLAKE:  What ’ s your name , please ?
ALEX:  Robert . Philips Robert .
ALEX: The environment varies greatly because of difference in language , customs and traditions .
BLAKE:  Yes . This gap can be filled by export market research before exporting .
ALEX:  But the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers .
BLAKE:  That's right . They do not appreciate its value and consider it to be a luxury .
ALEX:  Therefore , when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market , they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount .
BLAKE:  Exactly !
ALEX: Hello , I really appreciate the opportunity to interview for this position .
BLAKE:  I was wondering if you like team projects , or projects that you work on alone .

ALEX:  Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ?
BLAKE:  Ok . Does he know your number ?

ALEX:  What about the loan repayment ?
BLAKE:  You may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank , for example , payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments .

ALEX:  We spoke with you the first week we moved in about things that you promised to fix .
BLAKE:  Where do you think you have problems ?
ALEX:  There is no hot water , the bedroom has a broken window , and there are rats in the kitchen .
BLAKE:  You know , no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before .
ALEX:  You are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment .
BLAKE:  I will fix these problems when I get around to it .
ALEX:  I will be withholding my rent check this Friday unless these problems are addressed immediately .
BLAKE:  You can ’ t do that ! It ’ s illegal !
ALEX: I can ’ t believe these skirts are so cheap .
BLAKE:  I know and they are really nice , too .

BLAKE:  But I don't speak English at all .
ALEX:  That's OK . The program is especially for the beginners like us .
BLAKE:  Really ? When is it on ?
ALEX:  It begins at 6:40 every morning , and it goes for 20 minutes .
BLAKE:  Thank you so much . I'll try and catch that .

BLAKE:  So we should take the advantage of it .
ALEX: I ’ m thinking about getting a pet , but I ’ m really not sure which animal would be suitable . Could you give me some advice ?
BLAKE:  Certainly ! The first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet . Dogs are very demanding . You need to take them for walks and they love to play . Cats , on the other hand , are more independent .
ALEX:  I ’ m fairly busy , so I really need an animal that I don ’ t need to care of very much . Actually , I ’ d like a pet that ’ s a little unusual . I don't ’ really want a typical pet , like a cat , dog , or hamster . Do you have any suggestions ?
BLAKE:  Unusual pet are often more expensive to keep . Is that a problem ?
ALEX:  Not really . By the way , I don ’ t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake .
BLAKE:  We have those , but I only sell them to people I know well , for obvious reasons . How about a lizard ? I have some that are very brightly coloured , are not aggressive , and are easy to feed and look after .
ALEX:  That sounds ideal . Could you show me some ?
BLAKE:  Sure . Come over here . As you can see , I have a wide selection of species . They can live together , if you want lizards of different kinds . Do you have a favourite colour ?
ALEX:  I like the red one . What do they eat ?
BLAKE:  You can feed them on various things . They will eat small pieces of meat , but I ’ d recommend insects . You can get them from your garden , but remember that lizards eat a lot insects . I sell them here .
ALEX:  Thanks a lot . What I ’ ll do si find out more online and drop by next week .
BLAKE:  That ’ s fine . You shouldn ’ t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet .
ALEX: I'd like to make sure my plane reservation is in order .
BLAKE:  May I have your flight number , please ?
ALEX:  World Airlines , Flight 201 .
BLAKE:  And your name , please ?

ALEX:  I ’ Ve researched the company and think I ’ m perfect for the job but I ’ m not sure how to get it across to them .
BLAKE:  Well first you have to have more confidence.Employers look for people who are interested , enthusiastic and sure of themselves .
ALEX:  I know I have what it takes but Im worried that my work experience won ’ t sufficient . Should I inflate my experience ?
BLAKE:  No , you should always be upfront and honest about your weaknesses . However by focusing on your strong points and maintaining a positive attitude about your abilities , you can take the attention

ALEX:  My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ?
BLAKE:  There ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ?
ALEX:  Yes , I do . I don ’ t like it very much .
BLAKE:  I work in a cubicle too , but I I don ’ t mind it .

BLAKE:  It will be held on October 15th .
ALEX:  Should I arrive early or on time ?
BLAKE:  You'd better be early in case that you may be late because of traffic jam . That will put you in a insurmountable place .
ALEX: How do you like your overcoat , sir ?
BLAKE:  It's a bit too large . Would you please shorten the sleeves ?
ALEX:  OK , no problem . Let me take your measurement .
BLAKE:  Besides , can you take up the hem one inch ?
ALEX:  Fine .
ALEX: We need a person who knows how to operate and repair all kinds of office appliances .
BLAKE:  I used to hold a similar job for six years .
ALEX:  So you're quite confident in your experience and skill
BLAKE:  I think so .
ALEX: Yes , sir.May I help you ?
BLAKE:  Please I'd like a ticket to New York .
ALEX:  For today ?
BLAKE:  No , early saturday morning .
ALEX:  We have a flight that we'll put you there at ten AM.Is that ok ?
BLAKE:  Nothing earlier ? I prefer flight at nine thirty .
ALEX:  I'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight .
BLAKE:  No , exactly not
ALEX:  How about afternoon ?
BLAKE:  Sounds not good . I won't take it .
ALEX: We have settled the question of price , quality and quantity . Now I am calling to talk about the terms of payment . What are your terms of payment ?
BLAKE:  Well . We only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable L \ C , payable against shipping documents .
ALEX:  I see . Payment by LC is the safest method , but could you make an exception and accept DA or DP ?
BLAKE:  I'm afraid not . That is our usual practice , because we are sure we will get the right amount of money that way .
ALEX:  What about the cost of delivery ?
BLAKE:  We would like to do it in accordance with an F . O . B .
ALEX: What may I help you with ?
BLAKE:  I need to file a complaint .
ALEX:  What is your complaint about ?
BLAKE:  I got robbed .
ALEX:  When did this happen ?
BLAKE:  It happened this morning .
ALEX:  What was taken ?
BLAKE:  My wallet and cell phone .
ALEX:  Did you get a good look at the person who robbed you ?
BLAKE:  I sure did .
ALEX:  Would you able to pick him out of a line-up ?
BLAKE:  That shouldn't be a problem .
ALEX: Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money .
BLAKE:  Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ?
ALEX:  Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg .
BLAKE:  I don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate .
ALEX:  But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .
BLAKE:  Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .
ALEX:  Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash .
ALEX: Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ?
BLAKE:  Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff .
ALEX:  I see . And how about the working hours ?
BLAKE:  Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times .
ALEX:  Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me .
BLAKE:  Good , as long as you understand that .
ALEX:  And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ?
BLAKE:  Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month .

BLAKE:  Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
ALEX:  Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
ALEX:  Looks good ! I ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
BLAKE:  Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ’ t forget the syrup !

ALEX: Nice to meet you , sir . I come from New Times Clothes Company . We learnt that your exhibits on the Trade Fair in Shanghai this month were marvelous . Would you please quote the price ?
BLAKE:  Before we discuss the price , may I ask you what kind of exhibits you are interested in ?
ALEX:  Your summer clothes for white-collar and men's jackets .
BLAKE:  Can you give us a rough idea of the quantity you require ? It is generally known that the price varies according to the quantity .
ALEX:  That is to say , 10000 sets for the one of white-collar and 5000 for men's jackets .
BLAKE:  In that case , our offer for the white-collar series is US $ 200 , and the other is US $ 300 per set .

BLAKE:  OK ! I expect you to accept our general terms and conditions of trade . We believe that through our cooperation , large transactions will be brought to speedy conclusion .
ALEX: Welcome . Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Do you have any postcards ?
ALEX:  Yes , here are what we have exclusively for our guests .
BLAKE:  Can I have one each ?
ALEX:  Sure . Take as much as you want . They are free gifts from this shop .
BLAKE:  Is there anywhere I can buy some more cards with beautiful scenery ?
ALEX:  Please try the shop there . They might have them .
BLAKE:  Are their cards free , too ?
ALEX:  No , their cards are for sale .
ALEX: So what do you think of my new dress ?
BLAKE:  I think it ’ s great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I ’ Ve actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine ’ s for a while now , but I wasn ’ t sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment .
ALEX:  Um , ninety-five dollars ?
BLAKE:  Yes , that ’ s the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ?
ALEX:  I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen ’ s Boutique . I didn ’ t know I could get it cheaper somewhere else .
BLAKE:  Of course ! Everything at Helen ’ s is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn ’ t you shop around ?
ALEX:  I don ’ t know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive .
ALEX: Long time no see , George !
BLAKE:  Yes , a very long time .
ALEX:  What brings you here ?
BLAKE:  I'm here on vacation .
ALEX: Hello , this is ABC Corporation . May I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I ’ m enquiring about your advertisement for a sales manager in today ’ s newspaper . Is this position still open ?
ALEX:  Yes , but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I have a lot of previous experiences in sales . I worked in sales departments for two companies since I finished my university .
ALEX:  That sounds fine . Please give me your name and phone numbers . I ’ ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . It will most likely be in a couple of days . Is it all right for you ?

ALEX:  Are you interested in making this investment ?
BLAKE:  We haven't decided yet , we will let you know if we do .
ALEX: David , how is your interview ?
BLAKE:  I was nervous at that time . What about you ?
ALEX:  Just fine . I tried to answer every question raised by HR carefully . I found some answering skills are useful . These questions are different from exams .
BLAKE:  We can have a rest now after this tough interview .
ALEX:  Don't be rush . It is suggested to write a letter for the Personnel Department of Future Clothes Company .
BLAKE:  Sounds like a good idea . And I think this can leave deep impression to HR . How can we write a suitable letter ?
ALEX:  Just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company . And you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you .
BLAKE:  I am getting to know your meaning .
ALEX: Good morning , I made an appointment with Dr . Smith , but I have to change it .
BLAKE:  When you made your appointment , what day did you choose ?
ALEX:  My appointment was on Wednesday .
BLAKE:  At what time was that appointment ?
ALEX:  It was for 4
BLAKE:  I can see the appointment that you had . What day do you need to change to ?
ALEX:  I want to change to next Tuesday .
BLAKE:  What time would you prefer ?

BLAKE:  I will put you down for that time . Thank you for calling to reschedule .
ALEX: Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  En , I am looking for a porter , do you know where I can find one ?
ALEX:  There are so many here.The men with red hats are the porters .
BLAKE:  What's the charge ?
ALEX:  Well , it depends how many pieces of luggages you have .
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX: Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ?
BLAKE:  Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers .
ALEX:  Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ?
BLAKE:  Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion .
ALEX:  I didn ’ t pay attention to that .
ALEX: Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ?
BLAKE:  It's a difficult choice.The train is a little faster , but much more expensive .
ALEX:  We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams .
BLAKE:  Buses are more cramps and you can't walk around .
ALEX:  That's true.But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus .
BLAKE:  Really ? I think you see more traveling by train .
ALEX:  So which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
BLAKE:  I prefer going by train , even though it costs more .
ALEX:  Ok , then we'll go by train . I'm sure we'll have a good journey.Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ?
BLAKE:  The trains aren't usually full.We can get them on the day we travel.We should buy return tickets , because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles .
ALEX:  We should take a packed lunch on the journey.The food they sell on the trains is always expensive .
ALEX: Did you hear about Lulu ?
BLAKE:  No , what ?
ALEX:  She and Vic broke up and now she ’ s asked for a transfer .
BLAKE:  Get out of here ! I didn ’ t even know they were dating !
ALEX:  No one really did . They were very discreet and professional at the office .
ALEX: Here's a model of our latest design . What do you think of it ?
BLAKE:  Well , I'm not too happy about it .
ALEX:  What's wrong with it ?
BLAKE:  Well , I'm afraid it's not at all what I wanted . You haven't really followed my instructions.It ' ll have to be done again .
ALEX:  Oh , dear !
ALEX: Hello , this is the International Youth Hotel . How can I help you ?
BLAKE:  oh , yes . I want to check whether you still have any vacancies . I need three single rooms for next Monday .
ALEX:  ok . There're vacancies . Since the peak season is coming , it's advisable to book soon . Would you like to make a reservation now ?
BLAKE:  yes , please . Do you take credit cards ?
ALEX:  yes , we accept all major credit cards .
BLAKE:  and how about Internet access ?
ALEX:  there's free Internet access in the lobby .
BLAKE:  is it available in the rooms ?
ALEX:  Unfortunately not .
BLAKE:  that's OK . Is breakfast included ?
ALEX:  yes , breakfast is included and parking is available .
BLAKE:  fantastic . Thank you very much .
ALEX:  you're welcome . And we have 24 hour reception . Please don't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions .
ALEX: I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted .
BLAKE:  You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard .
ALEX:  You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well . What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation .
ALEX: What sort of shopping is nearby , Mr . Taylor ?
BLAKE:  Call me John . This is a great area of the city for shopping . There ’ s a grocery store just around the corner .
ALEX:  What about things other than food ?
BLAKE:  Well , the Riverside Mall has 200 stores in it , including four major department stores .
ALEX:  Are there small shops near here as well ?
BLAKE:  Yes , on 4th street , near the movie theater there are many specialty shops , including clothing boutiques .
ALEX:  Well , that sounds just wonderful .
BLAKE:  Yes , it ’ s a really nice neighborhood .
ALEX: Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it .
BLAKE:  Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know.Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more .
ALEX:  But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished .
BLAKE:  But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely .
ALEX:  Well , only you liked it really , darling .
BLAKE:  Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy .
ALEX: Hi , Bob , everything okay ?
BLAKE:  More or less . There's just one thing bothering me .
ALEX:  Oh ? What's that ?
BLAKE:  Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
ALEX:  What gift ?
BLAKE:  It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it .
ALEX:  You refused the gift ? That's terrible .
BLAKE:  I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way .
ALEX:  Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
BLAKE:  That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .
ALEX: I've been looking for a swimming pool , but I haven't found one yet .
BLAKE:  We have no pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in our gym .
ALEX:  Swim stations ? Could you be a little more explicit ?
BLAKE:  You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere ? Well , it's the same thing .
ALEX:  Gee , that's a great idea . Now , how much do I have to pay ?
BLAKE:  The stations are absolutely free to guests , sir .
ALEX:  Great ! Now , when can I go down there and use the stations ?
BLAKE:  The swim stations are open daily from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m .
ALEX:  Boy , oh boy ! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks .
BLAKE:  Be warned , sir . At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded .
ALEX: Hi . Today , I am the interviewer for your visa application .
BLAKE:  OK . Here is my application form and all the documents .
ALEX:  Can you tell me why do you want a visa to America ?
BLAKE:  Because I want to have a view of the exotic landscapes to extend my views and understanding of the world .
ALEX:  OK . Do you plan to go to America all by yourself or with your family ?
BLAKE:  Myself .
ALEX:  Have you finished all you preparation ?
BLAKE:  Yes . Everything is ready .
ALEX: What a pity you are leaving so soon . I wish you could stay a few more days . Sir , can you deliver a speech for us ?
BLAKE:  Dear friends . Here , I wish to say a word of thanks for holding this send-off party for me . Actually I didn't expect at all for this . I owe a lot to all of you here . It's been 5 days since I came to visit here . Time really flies . I feel grateful for your welcome and help in the five days . I will miss you while I am leaving . Let's keep in touch in any way .

BLAKE:  How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need ?
ALEX:  We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home .
BLAKE:  Do you need to be located in a particular school district ?
ALEX:  It doesn ’ t matter , as we do not have any children .
BLAKE:  Is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ?

ALEX:  Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
BLAKE:  Thank you .

BLAKE:  My present pay is 100,000 Yuan per year .
ALEX:  What are your salary expectations now ?
BLAKE:  I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 120,000 Yuan per year .

BLAKE:  I think you'll find I'm worth that .
ALEX:  I can only offer you 110,000 Yuan a year . Raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance . Is that satisfactory ?

ALEX:  Would 1 : OO p . m . be convenient ?
BLAKE:  Yes , she's free then .
ALEX: Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache .
BLAKE:  You should go to the dentist .
ALEX:  I hate dentists .
BLAKE:  Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .
ALEX:  It always hurts . I hate going .
BLAKE:  Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
ALEX:  O . K . , O . K . , I ’ ll go .
BLAKE:  Good . You feel better after you do .
ALEX: Sally , you look so corporate ! What interview do you have today ?
BLAKE:  Amalgamated Trading Company . It's Swiss . Don't you think working at a foreign company would be glamorous ?
ALEX:  Yeah , I guess so . I've never actually heard of this one , but ...
BLAKE:  Well , it's small , but it's a young , dynamic , rapidly-growing company with a progressive , humanistic philosophy .
ALEX:  You didn't read their brochure or anything , did you ?
BLAKE:  Four times . I'm totally prepared . Oh , no ! I forgot to take off my nail polish ! And I have to be there in 15 minutes ! That's it . I blew it .
ALEX:  Well , they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they don't care about nail polish ... uh ... even blue nail polish . Just keep your confidence up and you'll do great .
BLAKE:  But the competition is fierce this year ... and it seems like I'm the only one left who hasn't found a job .
ALEX:  Not quite the only one . I really wanted that job at the magazine , but I still haven't heard from them .
ALEX: I'm calling to tell you that the merchandise ordered last month has not arrived yet .
BLAKE:  I'm sorry , hold on a moment . I'll check it out . But we have already shipped it to you last month . Would you like us to contact the express company to know what's going on ?
ALEX:  Please find out the reason as soon as possible . We are in bad need of it .
BLAKE:  Ok , I am terribly sorry for the trouble you are getting into.We will contact you first thing , once we know the reason .
ALEX: I really want to make something for dinner .
BLAKE:  What are you going to cook ?
ALEX:  I haven't the slightest clue what I'm going to make .
BLAKE:  A teriyaki bowl sounds nice .
ALEX:  I don't know how to make that .
BLAKE:  All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef .
ALEX:  That sounds fairly simple , but how do I cook it ?
BLAKE:  The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice .
ALEX:  What's next ?
BLAKE:  Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it .
ALEX:  What's the next thing I need to do ?
BLAKE:  Then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy .
ALEX: How do I submit an expense report ?
BLAKE:  You need all your receipts for reimbursement .
ALEX:  You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ?
BLAKE:  Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I ’ ll get it signed for you .
ALEX: Good morning !
BLAKE:  Can I speak to Miss Cooper please ?
ALEX:  Would you hold on a second , please ? Miss Cooper's extension is engaged .
BLAKE:  Engaged . Oh , dear ! Could you tell her it's a long-distance call ?
ALEX:  I'm sorry , sir . I can't interrupt her . I'm sure she won't be very long .
BLAKE:  How long do you think she'll be ?
ALEX:  I really can't say how long she'll be .
BLAKE:  Can I leave a message , please ?
ALEX:  Yes , certainly .
BLAKE:  Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ?
ALEX:  Yes , sir . I'll ring her on an inside line if you like .
BLAKE:  Thank you very much .
ALEX: Excuse me , waiter , would you please bring us a nest ? A friend of mine will join us .
BLAKE:  Wait a moment . Here you are .
ALEX:  By the way , we would like to order some dishes for my friend .
BLAKE:  Sure .
ALEX: Can you help me out , Chuck ?
BLAKE:  Sure . What's it , Yvonne ?
ALEX:  I want to put my desk over there , but it's too heavy for me to move .
BLAKE:  Okay , you take one end and I'll take the other .
ALEX: Good morning . Madam . What can I do for you today ?
BLAKE:  Hello . I hope you can help me ; I'm a little worried about my new card .
ALEX:  What seems to be the problem ?
BLAKE:  I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it .
ALEX:  Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ?
BLAKE:  No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it !
ALEX:  You said you received your card this morning , am I right ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ?
ALEX:  Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons .
BLAKE:  Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me .
ALEX: Can you manage chopsticks ?
BLAKE:  Why not ? See .
ALEX:  Good mastery . How do you like our Chinese food ?
BLAKE:  Oh , great ! It's delicious . You see , I am already putting on weight . There is one thing I don't like however , MSG .
ALEX:  What's wrong with MSG ? It helps to bring out the taste of the food .
BLAKE:  According to some studies it may cause cancer .
ALEX:  Oh , don't let that worry you . If that were true , China wouldn't have such a large population .
BLAKE:  I just happen to have a question for you guys . Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables ? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated .
ALEX:  I don't know exactly . It's a tradition . Maybe it's for sanitary reasons .
ALEX: Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ?
BLAKE:  It was a nightmare .
ALEX:  What ’ s up ?
BLAKE:  Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
ALEX:  Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?
BLAKE:  Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout .
ALEX:  This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ?
BLAKE:  I am still waiting for their call .
ALEX:  Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward .
ALEX: Do you have any seat preferences , sir ?
BLAKE:  Yes , could you put me in the no-smoking section ?
ALEX:  Yes . Would you like a window seat ?
BLAKE:  If one's available , please . But not over the wing .
ALEX: morning . Rent-A-Car Agency . May I help you ?
BLAKE:  Good morning . This is Paul Alexander calling from the Isis Advertising Firm . We need a car to the airport for Mr . Phillips .
ALEX:  Certainly , Mr . Alexander . When would Mr . Phillips like to leave ?
BLAKE:  Let me check ... His flight ’ s at 2:30 p . m . , so he should leave no later than 12 noon .
ALEX: I'm calling today about a bill that I never received .
BLAKE:  Can you tell me which credit card it was for ?
ALEX:  It was for my Master Card .
BLAKE:  You should've gotten that bill two weeks ago .
ALEX:  I haven't got it in the mail yet .
BLAKE:  The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed .
ALEX:  What am I supposed to do about my bill then ?
BLAKE:  Maybe you should call your post office .
ALEX:  But if it's their mistake , can I get an extension on my bill payment ?
BLAKE:  Yes , but you will need to send us proof of their mistake .
ALEX:  Okay , thank you very much for your help .
BLAKE:  Not a problem . Enjoy the rest of your day .
ALEX: Jenny , don't you think it's really charming ?
BLAKE:  Yes . It's a feast of eyes to walking in the museum .
ALEX:  Let's take our time and enjoy the art and sprite of the famous museum .
BLAKE:  What a shame that we can't take pictures .
ALEX: OK , Allen . It's your turn . Are you ready ?
BLAKE:  I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ?
ALEX:  Come on ! In the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song !
BLAKE:  I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night .
ALEX:  Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him . He loves " The King . "
BLAKE:  I'll put the song at the front of the list .
ALEX: Here is the document you asked for this morning .
BLAKE:  Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks .
ALEX:  You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later .
BLAKE:  This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ?
ALEX:  The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
BLAKE:  Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do .
ALEX: How are you doing , Jim ?
BLAKE:  Fine , just fine.How about you ?
ALEX:  Not too bad .
ALEX: I think your presentation impressed the client , Daniel . You did a good job .
BLAKE:  Thank you , Mr . Cooper . I hope we get the contract .
ALEX: What's for lunch ?
BLAKE:  Pork chops .
ALEX: What happened to you ?
BLAKE:  I think I caught a cold .
ALEX:  Do you have any symptoms ?
BLAKE:  Runny nose and coughing .
ALEX:  Do you have a fever ?
BLAKE:  I have just taken the temperature , I don't think so .
ALEX:  It's not serious .
BLAKE:  Are you sure ?
ALEX:  Yes .
BLAKE:  What should I do ?
ALEX:  You should drink more hot water , and do some exercise .
ALEX: What kind of place shall we rent ?
BLAKE:  It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .
ALEX:  Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .
BLAKE:  Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area .
ALEX:  I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
BLAKE:  Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
ALEX:  Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
BLAKE:  How much do you think the rent will be ?
ALEX:  I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
ALEX: I don't think we can meet the delivery date you suggest . It's too soon .
BLAKE:  Well , is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of June ?
ALEX:  The earliest we can do is by the end of June .
ALEX: Did you have any working experience during college ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I did some part-time jobs such as English tutor , salesman , and model .
ALEX:  What did you learn from your part-time jobs ?
BLAKE:  I learned to be patient , professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .
ALEX: Smells good ! What ’ s for breakfast ?
BLAKE:  Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast !
ALEX:  Nice ! Brunch !
BLAKE:  Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
ALEX:  Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
ALEX:  Looks good ! I ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
BLAKE:  Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ’ t forget the syrup !
ALEX: Can you tell me if there is a flight to New York ?
BLAKE:  Yes . Flight DB117 departs at 5:38 pm and arrives in New York at 6:00 am with a layover in Chicago . It also makes a refueling stop at Colombia .
ALEX:  So many stops ! Don't you have any direct flights ?
BLAKE:  Sorry sir , it is the only flight wa have right now .
ALEX: Hello.Hot water overflowed from the bathtub.Will you help me ?
BLAKE:  Would you turn off the tap ?
ALEX:  I did it .
BLAKE:  Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door ?
ALEX:  OK . I will .
BLAKE:  I'll have our housekeeper come right away .
ALEX:  I'm sorry I was too tired to fall asleep .
BLAKE:  When you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub .
ALEX:  Right.Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ?
ALEX: Would you like some more coffee ?
BLAKE:  No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .
ALEX:  The waitress is bringing the bill right now .
BLAKE:  This waitress has really been on top of things , hasn't she ?
ALEX:  Yes , this waitress did a great job .
BLAKE:  OK , let's see what the damage is . The total for our meal is $ 36.00 .
ALEX:  What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ?
BLAKE:  Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ?
ALEX:  Yes , 20 % would be perfect .
BLAKE:  Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . The total will be $ 43.20 .
ALEX:  Yes , that was one fantastic meal !
BLAKE:  I agree . Maybe we can come back again next week .
ALEX: It ’ s time for me to go now .
BLAKE:  Would you like me to go with you ?
ALEX:  I ’ d rather you stayed in the office and did these things .
BLAKE:  Do you want to type that letter ?
ALEX:  I ’ d rather you typed it .
BLAKE:  Do you want to tell her ?
ALEX:  I ’ d rather you told her .
ALEX: Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head .
BLAKE:  What crime did I commit ?
ALEX:  You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs , so we are taking you into custody . We ’ Ve found some heroin in your house . You have the following rights while you are being interviewed . You have the right to remain silent . You don't have to make any statement against your will . You have the right to defense counsel . You have the right to request an investigation of evidence favorable to your case . Do you understand your rights ?
BLAKE:  I am innocent .
ALEX: Would you like to come by and play bridge ?
BLAKE:  Well , let's see . Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time .
ALEX:  Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired .
BLAKE:  Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies .
ALEX:  Oh , we always go to the movies . Can't we do something different ?
BLAKE:  Well , do you have any suggestions ?
ALEX:  Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ?
BLAKE:  It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things .
ALEX:  Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
BLAKE:  OK .
ALEX:  Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ?
ALEX: Tom , it's time for you to go to bed .
BLAKE:  Good night , mum .
ALEX:  Good night .
ALEX: Operator . May I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes . How do I get an outside line , please ?
ALEX:  Just dial 0 , wait for the dial tone , and then dial the phone number you want to call . Or we can place a call for you , if you want .
BLAKE:  No , thanks a lot . I'll try it myself .
ALEX: What's our target audience for this campaign ?
BLAKE:  This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two .
ALEX:  Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ?
BLAKE:  Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here .
ALEX:  Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ?
BLAKE:  Demographics say an average age of 28.7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year .
ALEX: John , I'd like to see you in my office for a minute .
BLAKE:  Yes , sir , I'll be there in just a moment .
ALEX:  John , I have been watching you . I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed . You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . I just want to let you to know , after this month's performance reviews , I'm recommending you for promotion .
BLAKE:  Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department .
ALEX:  Well , it's not going to be in our department . I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . There's supervisory spot opening up in financial . I'm turning your name in for it .
BLAKE:  Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff .
ALEX:  You've earned it .
ALEX: How can I help you today ?
BLAKE:  I am returning something that I bought yesterday .
ALEX:  What would you like to return ?
BLAKE:  I'm returning a cellphone .
ALEX:  Was there something wrong with it ?
BLAKE:  It's defective .
ALEX:  What isn't working on it ?
BLAKE:  It keeps turning off on it's own .
ALEX:  Alright , do you have the receipt ?
BLAKE:  I have it right here .
ALEX:  I'm going to take care of this and refund your money .
BLAKE:  Thanks for your help .
ALEX: I miss grandma . I dreamed about her yesterday .
BLAKE:  Dear , let ’ s drop the subject .
ALEX: Good morning , sir . Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Good morning . I'd like to cash this check .
ALEX:  Yes , sir . Can you show you identity ?
BLAKE:  What about the driving license ?
ALEX:  Don't you have any other identification ?
BLAKE:  I am sorry . I only have my driving license with me .
ALEX:  Ok . Would you please sign your name on the back of the check ?
BLAKE:  Thank you . Here you are .
ALEX:  How do you want your money ?
BLAKE:  Would you give me some in twenties and tens ?
ALEX:  All right . Please wait for a moment .
ALEX: Could you fill in this form , please ?
BLAKE:  All right .
ALEX:  Have you got any identification ?
BLAKE:  Yes , here's my ID card .
ALEX: Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !
BLAKE:  What ? What did you buy ?
ALEX:  It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !
BLAKE:  What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
ALEX:  There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick .
BLAKE:  And ?
ALEX:  So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .
BLAKE:  And it's a brick ?
ALEX:  Yes .
BLAKE:  I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?
ALEX:  I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .
BLAKE:  So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .
ALEX:  Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .
BLAKE:  But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
ALEX:  He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .
BLAKE:  Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !
ALEX:  C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .
BLAKE:  That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .
ALEX:  You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?
ALEX: Hello , Arthur . What seems to be the problem ?
BLAKE:  Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ’ m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision .
ALEX:  Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK , then , cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you .
BLAKE:  Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign .
ALEX:  Wow , Arthur ! You ’ re as blind as a bat !
BLAKE:  Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times .
ALEX:  Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription .
BLAKE:  Thanks doc !
ALEX:  Arthur , that ’ s the bathroom .
ALEX: Would you like some more coffee ?
BLAKE:  No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .
ALEX:  Good luck finding the waitress !
BLAKE:  The service this evening has kind of sucked . Is that our server over there ?
ALEX:  I'll go get the check , since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way .
BLAKE:  Good . I'll just stay here until you get back .
ALEX:  So the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner .
BLAKE:  How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ?
ALEX:  I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service .
BLAKE:  I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight .
ALEX:  I think that we should leave 10 % .
BLAKE:  $ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip .
ALEX: I want to fly to Congo on Monday , the 17th .
BLAKE:  Let me see what's available .
ALEX:  By the way , I'd prefer a night flight .
BLAKE:  Africa Airline 551 leaves at 9:00 pm .
ALEX:  That's fine . I want to pay in cash . Here is the money .
ALEX: How much was your watch ?
BLAKE:  Take a guess .
ALEX: A guy in my office got the flu the other day . Today I seem to have come down with it , too .
BLAKE:  Very likely . You have a slight fever . Do you have a headache , too ?
ALEX:  Yes . I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because I'll be on a business trip in two days .
BLAKE:  Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery .
ALEX:  But I'm going on a business trip in two days !
BLAKE:  Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others .
ALEX: Would you care for a drink ?
BLAKE:  No , thanks . I'm fine .
ALEX: Let's go practice your driving .
BLAKE:  If that's what you want to do , then we can .
ALEX:  Did you buckle your seatbelt ?
BLAKE:  I'm buckled up . What's next ?
ALEX:  You need to start the car now .
BLAKE:  What do you want me to do ?
ALEX:  Go left .
BLAKE:  How far should I go ?
ALEX:  I'll let you know when I want you to stop .
BLAKE:  Tell me before you want me to stop .
ALEX:  All right , try parking here .
BLAKE:  Thanks . Let's go driving again tomorrow .
ALEX: How may I help you ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m making a deposit today .
ALEX:  Cash or check ?
BLAKE:  I would like to deposit a check .
ALEX:  You need to sign the back .
BLAKE:  Okay . Here you go .
ALEX:  Would you like cash back ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I would .
ALEX:  How much ?
BLAKE:  Let me get $ 150 back .
ALEX:  Here you go .
BLAKE:  Thank you . Have a good one .
ALEX: I'd like to extend my visa for another two years .
BLAKE:  Are you on a tourist visa or a student visa ?
ALEX:  Student visa .
BLAKE:  What is the reason for extension ?
ALEX:  I'll go into a practical training as soon as I receive my Master ’ s degree from the University of Pennsylvania early next month .
BLAKE:  We ’ ll need a letter from your university and a financial statement from you .
ALEX: Do you like the apartment ?
BLAKE:  I absolutely love the apartment .
ALEX:  Everything is okay ?
BLAKE:  I do have one problem with the apartment .
ALEX:  What ’ s the problem ?
BLAKE:  I don ’ t like all those stains in the carpet .
ALEX:  We will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment .
BLAKE:  I did not know that .
ALEX:  I assure you that we will , and if there are any more problems , feel free to tell me .
BLAKE:  That was the only thing that I saw wrong with the apartment .
ALEX:  I ’ m glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice .
BLAKE:  It ’ s absolutely incredible . I ’ ll take it .
ALEX: Come in , Arnold . Have a seat .
BLAKE:  Good morning .
ALEX:  Would you like something to drink ?
BLAKE:  No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk .
ALEX:  So , you're a serious coffee drinker .
BLAKE:  Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted .
ALEX:  Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something.For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ?
BLAKE:  No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker .
ALEX:  Well , what would you like to talk to me about ?
BLAKE:  I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .
ALEX:  I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it .
BLAKE:  It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday .
ALEX:  Yes .
BLAKE:  Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here .
ALEX:  What do you suggest ?
BLAKE:  The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation .
ALEX:  You mean because people have to go across town to get here .
BLAKE:  Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road .
ALEX:  That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them .
BLAKE:  I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them .
ALEX:  I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that .
BLAKE:  Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more .
ALEX:  Well .
BLAKE:  I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that .
ALEX:  You mean you want to run the meetings ?
BLAKE:  No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .
ALEX:  Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks .
BLAKE:  I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized .
ALEX:  I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works .

BLAKE:  Don't rush , behave yourself please ! Let the people get off first .
ALEX:  Oh , we should . There are so many people . What if the train got full before we could get in ?
BLAKE:  But , if we all pushed our way in , nobody could get off , and nobody could get in either .
ALEX:  How many stops are there to the Aidan station ?
BLAKE:  There are four more stops .
ALEX:  Oh , my God !
BLAKE:  What's wrong ? You are like a little monkey , on pins and needles !
ALEX:  Because I need to use the restroom . Is there a restroom on the train ?
BLAKE:  No , not on the train , but in the station .
ALEX:  Why not ? You told me that subway is a kind of train . If it had no restroom . what kind of train would that be ?
BLAKE:  Well , that is a question . You want to offer a suggestion ?

ALEX:  Oh , I see .
BLAKE:  Let's go to aisle 4 to pick up some pasta for tonight .
ALEX:  Great ! Pasta for dinner .
BLAKE:  And let's get a loaf of bread at the bakery for breakfast .
ALEX:  Maybe we should get a shopping cart .
BLAKE:  I'll put the shopping basket back .
ALEX: Did you lock the doors ?
BLAKE:  All except the back door . I left that open for Tim . He took the dog for a walk .
ALEX:  Well , I'm going on to bed . I'm beat .
BLAKE:  Okay . I'm going to stay up a while . I've got to go over the household budget . We're a little overspent this month .
ALEX:  Please tell Tim to close the door to the basement . I don't want the dog down there tonight .
BLAKE:  Okay . Good night . See you at breakfast .
ALEX: Well , I'm glad you're finally back . I was wondering what happened .
BLAKE:  I feel kind of stupid .
ALEX:  Why ?
BLAKE:  We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet .
ALEX:  You got lost . You're kidding !
BLAKE:  No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost .
ALEX:  You could have called .
BLAKE:  I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were .
ALEX:  You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ?
BLAKE:  Guess where we ended up .
ALEX:  I don't know . Where ?
BLAKE:  When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield .
ALEX:  Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ?
BLAKE:  I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
ALEX:  Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
BLAKE:  I know it is . I don't know how it happened .
ALEX:  Hmm , maybe I do .
BLAKE:  What ?
ALEX:  Maybe I have an idea how it happened .
BLAKE:  How ?
ALEX:  You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road .
BLAKE:  Oh , that's what you think , huh ?
ALEX: Won't you have some of this ?
BLAKE:  Yes , thanks .
ALEX:  It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue .
BLAKE:  It's very good . How do you make it ?
ALEX:  I use a special dressing and homemade catsup .
BLAKE:  This salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day .
ALEX:  I'm glad you like it .
BLAKE:  You Americans usually have nutritious food .
ALEX:  Oh , but Chinese food is so delicious . I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food . Do you follow recipes ?
BLAKE:  We use different spices but few people use recipes . They learn to cook by experience .
ALEX:  I always use a recipe but my grandmother never did . She was a great cook . She would make clam chowder and cornbread every Sunday night .
ALEX: I like these shoes .
BLAKE:  Do you realize that all these shoes are half off ?
ALEX:  Really ?
BLAKE:  Yes , but the offer only lasts this week .
ALEX: Do you have experience in advertising ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I used to have a part-time job in advertising company .
ALEX:  What were you mean duties there ?
BLAKE:  I mostly did advertising planning .
ALEX:  What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ?
BLAKE:  I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market .
ALEX:  What was the most important thing you have learned at work ?
BLAKE:  The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact in success . If I want to make in marking in advertising history , I can ’ t stop studying and creating .
ALEX: Dad , may I have a room of my own ?
BLAKE:  Oh , honey , I'm so sorry , we don't have enough space for you to have your own room .
ALEX:  Dad , but I don't want to share a room with Peter . He snores every night .
BLAKE:  Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ?
ALEX:  Alright . Maybe it's the only way to do it .
ALEX: Come in and sit down , Jack . Now , what's the trouble ?
BLAKE:  I've got a terrible pain in my stomach , Doctor .
ALEX:  I see . When did it start ?
BLAKE:  It started yesterday . I didn't eat any supper .
ALEX:  Have you got a temperature ?
BLAKE:  I think so . I feel very hot .
ALEX:  Let's see . Yes . You ' Ve got quite a high temperature .
BLAKE:  I've got an awful headache , too , and my throat hurts .
ALEX:  Hm ... I think you ' Ve got the flu .
BLAKE:  Is it serious ?
ALEX:  No , not at all , but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine .
BLAKE:  How often must I take it ?
ALEX:  Three times a day after meals .
BLAKE:  Thank you , Doctor.Goodbye .
ALEX: Our usual supplier has let us down and I ’ Ve been looking through your parts catalogue . I need fifty GT670s . How soon can you deliver ?
BLAKE:  Just a moment and I'll check . We ’ re expecting a delivery on Friday . We've only got ten in stock at the moment . I can deliver those by first thing tomorrow morning . There'll be an extra charge for special delivery . I'll have to send them by courier .
ALEX: Why don ’ t you sit down and relax , darling ?
BLAKE:  I don ’ t want to .
ALEX:  Well , come and talk to me then .
BLAKE:  Certainly not .
ALEX:  May I turn on the radio then ?
BLAKE:  Turn on the radio ? What for ?
ALEX:  So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
BLAKE:  Listen to some music ? And who ’ ll cook dinner ? Will you ?
ALEX:  Ok , I will . But let ’ s go to a disco after dinner .
BLAKE:  To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate pop .
ALEX: Good afternoon , ma'am . May I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes . Can I deposit valuables here ?
ALEX:  Of course , you can . Please put your articles in this bag and seal it .
BLAKE:  OK .
ALEX:  Thank you . Here is your tag .
BLAKE:  Would you tell me the rate per day for depositing my bag ?
ALEX:  Sure , madam . Only one dollar .
BLAKE:  When does the cloakroom close ?
ALEX:  This cloakroom is open until 10 p . m .
BLAKE:  Oh , dear ! I won't be back until about 11:30 tonight . Where can I pick up my bag ?

BLAKE:  6 hours . If you are in a hurry we can develop it in 3 hours .
ALEX:  There is no need . I will come back tomorrow .
ALEX: Good afternoon Miss , would you be interested in buying more life insurance ? You know , you can never get enough .
BLAKE:  I think my husband has some .
ALEX:  Are you sure he ’ s purchased enough insurance for both of you ? If something terrible happened with your husband , and he doesn ’ t have sufficient insurance , my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you .
BLAKE:  That ’ s true . If something happened to my husband , I might lose everything . Both of us have to work to keep our home , car , and our children ’ s education . I can ’ t afford that by myself .
ALEX:  Could we sit and look at the policy I mentioned and see if that ’ s something suitable for you and your husband ?
BLAKE:  Certainly .
ALEX: The buildings are really magnificent .
BLAKE:  Yes , millions of travelers come here every year for the view of the buildings .
ALEX:  The journey is worth while . Where are we going after this ?
BLAKE:  We will visit the Statue of Liberty as scheduled .
ALEX: Excuse me .
BLAKE:  Yes ?
ALEX:  Do you have any information about the city sights ?
BLAKE:  Sure . There ’ s a lot here in this pamphlet .
ALEX:  Thank you . And what ’ s the best way to get downtown ?
BLAKE:  Take the subway . It ’ s $ 1.50 per ride . You can buy a petrol card at the station .
ALEX:  You ’ Ve been very helpful .
BLAKE:  My pleasure .
ALEX: I want to open a saving account , sir.What ' s the proper procedure ?
BLAKE:  First , you fill out the application form and then we'll issue you a passbook .
ALEX:  Is there any minimum for the first deposit ?
BLAKE:  No , Even a dollar is all right.Here ' s your passbook , sir ; just sign your name on it .
ALEX:  What is the annual interest rate ?
BLAKE:  It varies from time to time.At present it is 6 % .
ALEX:  By the way , can I open a checking account too ?
BLAKE:  By all means.But you have to deposit enough money before you can write out your checks .
ALEX: You look depressed . What's on your mind ?
BLAKE:  Well , I had a blood test last week . The doctor said that I have high blood pressure and my blood is thick and sticky . I'm very worried .
ALEX:  Take it easy . When we last talked , you promised there would be more exercises in your life . But now you are putting on some weight .
BLAKE:  I have to admit it's easier said than done .
ALEX:  Well , I think it's time for you to change your eating habits and develop a healthy lifestyle . Regular exercise will improve your health .
BLAKE:  But you know I'm just not into exercises . And I wouldn't have time for exercises , either .
ALEX:  You can do some jogging . It's easy and it doesn't take much time .
BLAKE:  Actually , my doctor said the same thing .
ALEX: Excuse me , sir , but you have to put your bags here before entering the market .
BLAKE:  Oh . I am sorry . I was busy looking for some whisky.Can you tell me the exactly place where I can find any ?
ALEX:  Yes , it's on the third floor .
ALEX: Here ' s my passport . I'm a visiting scholar .
BLAKE:  Do you have anything to declare ?
ALEX:  No , these are all my personal effects .
BLAKE:  What's in the bag ? Would you mind opening the bag ?
ALEX:  Not at all . I don't know what's dutiable . Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use ?
BLAKE:  NO . You don't have to pay duty on personal belongings .
ALEX:  Thank you .
ALEX: Do you work well under pressure ?
BLAKE:  Working under pressure is exciting and challenging . I don ’ t mind working under pressure . I work well under that circumstance . People can , I can .
ALEX:  Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
BLAKE:  No , nothing in particular .
ALEX:  How soon can you begin working for us ?
BLAKE:  I need about two to three weeks for necessary formalities . I will quit then transfer to your company .
ALEX: What do you want ?
BLAKE:  I think I have a piece of apple pie .
ALEX:  Do you want something to drink ?
BLAKE:  Coffee would be fine .
ALEX:  OK . Sit down and I'll get it .
ALEX: Our new production control program's going live on Monday . The old and the new programs will operate in tandem for four to six weeks . That should give us time to iron out any little problems .
BLAKE:  Hope it all goes well . We're very busy at the moment and certainly don't want any problems at this time of year .
ALEX:  Yes , I realise that . We've spent a long time planning and preparing for the change-over . I'm confident we won't have any major problems .
ALEX: Who broke my chair ?
BLAKE:  It wasn't me .
ALEX: Can I help you , Madam ?
BLAKE:  Could you tell me what Ants on the Tree is please ?

ALEX: Come in , please .
BLAKE:  Good morning , sir !
ALEX:  Good morning , please make yourself comfortable .
BLAKE:  Thank you , sir .
ALEX:  Your name and examination number , please .
BLAKE:  My name is Du Tao , number 3 .
ALEX:  Pardon ?
BLAKE:  Du Tao . D-U for Du and T-A - 0 for Tao .

BLAKE:  I was born on January 1st , 1988 . I ’ m 20 years old now .
ALEX:  Where do you live ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m living at Room 222 , Building 18 , N . P . U .
ALEX:  Can you leave me your phone number ?
BLAKE:  Gladly , 8962105 2 .
ALEX: Good morning . May I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I'm looking for an apartment , I'd like two bedrooms .
ALEX:  All right . Have a seat , please . Let me ask you a few questions . First of all , may I have your name , please ?
BLAKE:  My name's Donald Eakins .
ALEX:  How do you spell your last name , Mr.Eakins .
BLAKE:  It's E-A-K-I-N-S .
ALEX:  E-A-K-I-N-S.First name , Donald . And what's your present address , Mr.Eakins ?
BLAKE:  It's 1446 Pine Street .
ALEX:  1446 Pine . That's in San Francisco , isn't it ?
BLAKE:  Yes , it is .
ALEX: Did you check before you left the shop ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I did . But when I got home , my son put it on and we found the hole .
ALEX:  Really ? Let me have a look at it . Mm . OK . Let me change it for another one .
BLAKE:  Thank you very much .
ALEX: I hate to do this , but I've got to cancel a reservation I made earlier this week .
BLAKE:  All I need is your name , phone , and reservation date .
ALEX:  My name is Rudy Randolph . I'm at 818-555-1234 . The reservation was for April 9 .
BLAKE:  Randolph , Rudy . Let me hit one button , sir , and now your reservation is cancelled .
ALEX:  Okay , thank you . I'll make another reservation as soon as I can .
BLAKE:  It's been my pleasure to help you .
ALEX: Did you go and buy your bus pass ?
BLAKE:  No , I didn't .
ALEX:  When are you going to go get it ?
BLAKE:  I'm not sure where they sell bus passes at .
ALEX:  Why didn't you just ask me ?
BLAKE:  Where should I go ?
ALEX:  You can get one from student services .
BLAKE:  I had no clue that I could get it there .
ALEX:  I already knew that .
BLAKE:  Thanks for letting me know .
ALEX:  You're welcome .
BLAKE:  I'm going to go and get it right now .
ALEX: Tomorrow is my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ?
BLAKE:  Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ’ s dress code .
ALEX:  Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt .
BLAKE:  Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean .
ALEX: Excuse me . Will you please keep an eye on my suitcase ? I just want to make a phone call .
BLAKE:  Certainly , but will it take long ?
ALEX:  No , I'll be right back .
BLAKE:  OK . I'll look after it then .
ALEX: Mike's Mechanics . Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes , how do I get to your shop from Chilin ?
ALEX:  Go straight up Zhongshan Road and you will see our sign on your right , after you pass the museum .
BLAKE:  Thank you very much .
ALEX: Don't take too much off . I'm trying to grow my hair longer .
BLAKE:  How about two inches ?
ALEX:  That sounds perfect . Do you think I can get some highlights today , too ? I've always wanted red .
BLAKE:  I think that will over-process your hair , you should wait at least two weeks .
ALEX:  All right . I'll just have the cut and perm today .
BLAKE:  Great . My assistant will wash your hair , and then I'll be back to help you .
ALEX:  OK .
ALEX: Oh , damn . There ’ s another traffic jam on the highway .
BLAKE:  How can there be a traffic jam on a 16 - lane highway every day ?
ALEX:  There are just too many people , and too many cars .
BLAKE:  I wonder if there was an accident .
ALEX:  No , they just said it too many people were trying to get off at the Capitol exits .
BLAKE:  Well , let ’ s put on some music . We ’ re going to be stuck in this for a while .
ALEX:  All right , what do you want to listen to ?
BLAKE:  How about some Beatles ?
ALEX:  Yeah , all right .
ALEX: Excuse me . Mr . Emory ?
BLAKE:  Yes , Ms . Rodriguez ? How can I help you ?
ALEX:  I wanted to see if I could arrange a meeting with you to discuss recruitment .
BLAKE:  Absolutely . I ’ Ve been wanting to meet with you about that . Let me just get my book .
ALEX: Who ate the cookies that were sitting here ?
BLAKE:  I did , Mom .
ALEX:  Shame on you . I was saving them for your brother .
ALEX: Hello . May I speak to Brian , please ?
BLAKE:  Sorry , you have the wrong number . There ’ s no Brian here .
ALEX:  Is this 777-9345 ?
BLAKE:  No , it ’ s 777-9344 ?
ALEX:  Oh , I ’ m so sorry .
BLAKE:  That ’ s OK .
ALEX: Put all baggage on the conveyor belt . Walk through the detector age one at a time , please .
BLAKE:  Excuse me , ma'ma . Could you walk back through the doorway again , please ?
ALEX:  What for ?
BLAKE:  Airport security . Could you empty your pockets over here , please ?
ALEX:  Really ? I'm in a hurry . All right .
BLAKE:  Ah , a set of keys .
ALEX:  I'm embarrassed ! I forgot completely about them . I'm terribly sorry .
BLAKE:  That's all right . Enjoy your flight .
ALEX:  Thank you .
ALEX: What's the matter with you , Paul ?
BLAKE:  I'm not feeling well . I think I'm having a cold .
ALEX:  Looks like it.You need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest .
BLAKE:  Yeah , I will .
ALEX: Come on . All of us are waiting for you .
BLAKE:  Oh , sorry . Cross my fingers .
ALEX: Come on , Mary . We have to do the laundry .
BLAKE:  Where are we going ?
ALEX:  Down to the basement .
BLAKE:  Do you have a washer down there ?
ALEX:  Yes . We have a dryer , too .
BLAKE:  That's so convenient . Where are the dirty clothes ?
ALEX:  They are in the basement already .
BLAKE:  But I didn't see you carry them down .
ALEX:  Don't you know that we have a laundry chute in the house ?
ALEX: Hi , John .
BLAKE:  Oh , hi , Mary , come on in . Any problem ?
ALEX:  Oh , no problem .
BLAKE:  Great . I forgot to ask you , though . How long did you want the place ?
ALEX:  Six months .
BLAKE:  Oh , well , that might be a problem . I usually only sign one year leases .
ALEX:  Well , one year would be fine , too . I ’ m not planning on leaving the area anytime soon .
BLAKE:  Well , if it ’ s not a problem . Then here you go .
ALEX:  Just let me look at it quickly .
BLAKE:  Of course .
ALEX:  Looks like a standard lease .
BLAKE:  Yeah , and don ’ t worry about the security deposit . If everything ’ s all right when you move out , you ’ ll get it back .
ALEX:  O . K . Great . Just sign and date it here ?
BLAKE:  Yes . Thanks . You can move your stuff in tomorrow .
ALEX:  Wonderful .
ALEX: Excuse me , could you tell me the bookshop ’ s address ?
BLAKE:  Yes , the bookshop is just around the corner.Turn left and you ’ ll see the bookshop .
ALEX:  Thank you very much.By the way , is the hospital beside the bookshop .
BLAKE:  Right , if you see the bookshop , you can see the hospital .
ALEX:  Thank you for your help .
BLAKE:  Not at all .
ALEX: Hello ! Is this Mr . Chang ?
BLAKE:  Yes . Who is speaking ?
ALEX:  This is Kelly speaking . I am calling from London . How are you , Mr . Chang ?
BLAKE:  Oh , Kelly , I couldn't recognize your voice . Well , I'm fine .
ALEX:  Mr . Chang , I just want to tell you that we are leaving London for Beijing by flight CP 645 on Saturday morning . Could you meet us at the airport , please ?
BLAKE:  Excuse me , I couldn't quite hear you . This line is crossed . Can you speak louder , please ?
ALEX:  I will say it again ... Do you hear me now ?
BLAKE:  Much better . I will definitely go to the airport to meet you .
ALEX:  Thank you very much . Goodbye .
BLAKE:  Goodbye .
ALEX: Hello , Mr . Hammer . Jack Ross here . I'm calling to confirm our appointment on Monday at ten o'clock in your office .
BLAKE:  Yes . Everything's all set .
ALEX:  I'd like to bring Mr . Huang and Ms . Sun with me .
BLAKE:  We're supposed to be meeting alone .
ALEX:  I know , but I think they may add something valuable to the discussion .
BLAKE:  Fine . But no one else , OK ?
ALEX:  Yes , Mr . Hammer .
ALEX: How beautiful the flower is !
BLAKE:  Really , it's so beautiful .
ALEX:  You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you .
BLAKE:  You mustn't pick it in this place .
ALEX:  Where it is ?
BLAKE:  It's a private garden .
ALEX: You look fresh recently . And .. what's your weight now ?
BLAKE:  110 pounds .
ALEX:  Really ? Congratulations ! That's really something beyond my imagination . How did you make it ? Did you keep on a diet ?
BLAKE:  No , you know I can't bear eating less .
ALEX:  Then do the slim pills take effect on you ?
BLAKE:  I've quit it already . I go to aerobics class everyday instead .
ALEX:  How's it going on ?
BLAKE:  You see . I've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite .
ALEX:  I'd better exercise my body too . My limbs are rusty now .
BLAKE:  I don't think so . You look full of energy every day . Time has stood still with you .
ALEX:  Thank you .
ALEX: Ahhs ! I'm beat !
BLAKE:  What happened to you ? You look like you got hit by a tornado !
ALEX:  I just got back from fighting the crowds .
BLAKE:  You mean at the mall ? Was there a sale ?
ALEX:  Yeah . For five minutes , everything was half off . It was total chaos ...
BLAKE:  Cool !
ALEX:  Grabbing , pushing and shoving ...
ALEX: Thank god you are open ! I have an emergency !
BLAKE:  Hello , Mr . Henderson what can I do for you ?
ALEX:  I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP !
BLAKE:  OK , I can have it ready by the end of the week .
ALEX:  No , you don ’ t understand , I need this tomorrow morning ! I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ’ s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! She ’ s gonna kill me !
BLAKE:  OK , I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon , but this suit is also very stained . I can ’ t guarantee we can remove it completely .
ALEX:  Fine ! Can you also iron and starch this shirt ?
BLAKE:  Certainly .
ALEX:  Great ! This is our secret ! If you see my wife , say nothing to her about this !
ALEX: How often does the bus run ?
BLAKE:  Every five minutes .
ALEX:  Oh , here comes a bus !
BLAKE:  It comes on the dot .
ALEX: My warmest congratulations on your promotion !
BLAKE:  Thanks . It ’ s nothing special actually .
ALEX:  Don ’ t say that . It owes to your efforts and team spirit .
BLAKE:  Oh , it was nothing . Anyone could have done it . I still have a lot to learn yet .
ALEX:  You are very modest . Best luck in your new position .
BLAKE:  Thank you . I won ’ t let this promotion change me .
ALEX: Yes , emergency . There is a huge fire here .
BLAKE:  Calm down , sir . What's your name and where are you now ?
ALEX:  My name is Jerry and we are on the intersection of West Road and East Road .
BLAKE:  Sir , leave the house if the fire draws any closer to your house . Our men will be over in 5 minutes .
ALEX: Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ?
BLAKE:  Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it .
ALEX:  Totally agree . What is your solution ?
BLAKE:  Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy .
ALEX:  You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
BLAKE:  It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
ALEX:  But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .
BLAKE:  I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
ALEX: Excuse me , is this the parcel counter ?
BLAKE:  Yes , what can I do for you ?
ALEX:  I'd like to send this parcel , please .
BLAKE:  What's in it , please ?
ALEX:  Some books and newspapers .
BLAKE:  OK . please fill in this form and label it .
ALEX:  Is it all right ?
BLAKE:  Yeah . And would you like to mail it by air ?
ALEX:  No , I'd rather send it by sea .
BLAKE:  Thirteen yuan , please . Here is the receipt and change .
ALEX:  Thank you .
BLAKE:  You are welcome .
ALEX: But Ernie , we're still missing something . We need someone to play the music !
BLAKE:  Oh right ... you know , my friend Eric is a DJ . Maybe he would like to play with us .
ALEX:  Hmm ... does he have a good ear for hip hop music ?
BLAKE:  Well , I don't know , but we can find out . We can talk to him and ask if he wants to join our group .
ALEX: Excuse me , is there any room available ? I want a single one .
BLAKE:  Yes . When do you want it ?
ALEX:  Next Today . By the way , is there a closed circuit TV ?
BLAKE:  Yes , sir .
ALEX:  What about laundry ?
BLAKE:  Sorry , sir . You have to pay by yourself .
ALEX: What time does the museum close ? Any idea ?
BLAKE:  I'm not sure , but I think It's open until 4 o'clock .
ALEX:  What time is it now ?
BLAKE:  It's a quarter past three .
ALEX: I would like to buy some local handcrafts as gifts to my friends and relatives .
BLAKE:  There are many stores selling handcrafts in Paris . Our store is wellknown for vase , table wear and jewelry boxes . You can take your time and choose whatever you like .
ALEX:  Well , the tapestry is delicate and beautiful .
BLAKE:  You have made an excellent choice , it is our newcomer . The tapestry is on hot sell with the design and quality . The design on it is traditional Paris architecture .
ALEX:  How much is it ?
BLAKE:  100 frances .
ALEX:  Mmm , it is reasonable . Look at this set of table wear , it is so beautiful !
BLAKE:  We have a piece of table clothing to go with it . It is a brocade one with pretty stars .
ALEX:  This silver vase is a good ornament for the living room .
BLAKE:  You are right .
ALEX:  I will take the tapestry , the set of table wear and the vase .
BLAKE:  OK . Do you like these candles ? They are on sale now .
ALEX:  All right . I will take one .
ALEX: It's so boring .
BLAKE:  Don't you like it ?
ALEX:  I don't . Is there anything worth watching on the other channel ?
BLAKE:  I think it's a basketball match on channel 5 .
ALEX:  Do you mind if we switch over ?
BLAKE:  Well , I'd rather see a movie .
ALEX:  What's the movie ?
BLAKE:  ' Star war ' .
ALEX:  It must be interesting .
BLAKE:  Yes , you're right .
ALEX: Where can I get my baggage ?
BLAKE:  Are you from a domestic flight or an international one ?
ALEX:  An international one from Seattle .
BLAKE:  In that case , you should go to the baggage hall over there .
ALEX:  Oh yes , I see the sign , thank you .
ALEX: Man ! That car almost hit me !
BLAKE:  Yeah , that was close .
ALEX: Excuse me .
BLAKE:  Yes ?
ALEX:  Could you tell me where the copy room is ?
BLAKE:  Sure . You just walk down this hallway . The copy room is the second room on the right .
ALEX: Doctor , save my baby , please
BLAKE:  What symptoms does he have ?
ALEX:  He has had a fever for one day . Just now at home , he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up . We were at a loss what to do . We called an ambulance and brought the baby here .
BLAKE:  How long did the convulsion last ?
ALEX:  About 3 minutes .
BLAKE:  Does he have any other complaints ?
ALEX:  Three days ago , he began to cough , sneeze and have a running nose . Yesterday , he began to have a fever .
BLAKE:  Have you taken his temperature ?
ALEX:  It was 38 ° C this morning and it was 39 ° C just now .
BLAKE:  Let me examine him to see if there is any rash . No rash .
ALEX:  Is it serious ? Is it meningitis ?
BLAKE:  No , it is not meningitis . Just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection .
ALEX:  Does he have to be admitted to hospital ?
BLAKE:  No . No need for admission . I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . Then I will give you a prescription . The pink tablets are used for his fever . When his temperature is over 38 ° C , give him one tablet . The other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions . The white liquid is for the cold . Give the baby plenty of water to drink .
ALEX:  Thank you very much , doctor .
ALEX: Jack ! Do you want to see a picture of my new puppy ?
BLAKE:  Sure . I thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies , not new pets !
ALEX:  Well , this is my new baby . He ’ s just as much trouble . That ’ s for sure ! But , he ’ s a lot of fun !
BLAKE:  I see what you mean . He ’ s really cute . How old is he ?
ALEX: Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me ! I ’ Ve always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me ! Let ’ s get started !
BLAKE:  Ok , let ’ s start opening some presents !
ALEX:  Oh look ! What a great little bib for the baby ! This will definitely come in handy ! Oh wow , you also got me a stroller ! That ’ s so great ! Thank you !
BLAKE:  This next one is from Betty .
ALEX:  A highchair and car seat ! Wow Betty , thank you so much ! I really appreciate it !
BLAKE:  One more from Carla .
ALEX:  A playpen and crib ! Thanks Carla ! This is just what I needed !
BLAKE:  OK , that ’ s all of them . No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ?
ALEX:  Umm . I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital !
ALEX: Wow , this is amazing . I'm glad we've come here . So cool .
BLAKE:  I always love skiing . You know , it's a cool game for cool people . Stay with me and you will be cool , too .
ALEX:  Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .
BLAKE:  Sure . It's probably the skiing show . Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
ALEX:  See that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .
BLAKE:  Hey , don't be so pathetic . It's a maximal sports show . What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
ALEX:  You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ?
BLAKE:  They are all very experienced and great skiers . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
ALEX:  Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow in here ?
BLAKE:  Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ?
ALEX:  Hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist .
BLAKE:  Sorry . Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .
ALEX:  Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
BLAKE:  It's possible . But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
ALEX:  It's a good thing . OK , let's go skiing .
BLAKE:  Here we go .
ALEX: Would you like a smoking or non-smoking room ?
BLAKE:  Non-smoking , please .

BLAKE:  Furnished .
ALEX:  Very well . How long do you want the house ? All summer ?
BLAKE:  No , not all summer . Just for six weeks .

BLAKE:  Then I'll have vanilla ice cream .
ALEX:  Fine . I will bring it right away .

BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX: Now people are talking about world recession which started more than a year ago . Can you give us your personal assessment of the situation of the global economy ?
BLAKE:  As you know , we are in a very special time . This is a very hard time for many countries ' economics , both developed and developing . I think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies .
ALEX:  What is the direct impact of the terrorist attack upon your country's economy ?
BLAKE:  Once the US economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack , the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world .
ALEX:  What challenges is your country's economy facing at the moment ?
BLAKE:  We do face a lot of challenges because there is still much uncertainty about the world economy . It's very important for us to strike a proper balance between investment in fixed assets and household consumption .
ALEX: So , what do you plan to do today ?
BLAKE:  There is a Matisse exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art . Larry and I will go .
ALEX:  Did you buy tickets already ?
BLAKE:  No . Do we need tickets ?
ALEX:  Well , probably . Probably you will have to wait in line if you don't have tickets .
BLAKE:  Outside or inside ?
ALEX:  Outside , on the sidewalk .
BLAKE:  Hmm . It's very cold today.But I brought my jacket . Maybe it will be alright to wait .
ALEX:  The MYOMA is very popular . There will be a lot of people .
BLAKE:  MYOMA ? What's that ?
ALEX:  Oh , sorry.It stands for the Museum of Modern Art . It's an acronym . M O M A MYOMA .
BLAKE:  I see . Do you have any suggestions for other things we should do ?
ALEX:  I suggest you go to the Jewish Museum.It ' s not far from the Guggenheim , near Central Park . It is really very interesting.Also , there is a great museum of medieval European art further up north.It ' s called the Cloisters .
BLAKE:  How can we get up there ?
ALEX:  You can take a bus .
BLAKE:  But Larry says the neighborhoods in the north are dangerous .
ALEX: Finally we have a long holiday .
BLAKE:  Yes , what about us having a tour ?
ALEX:  Good idea . Where shall we go ?
BLAKE:  How about Milan ?
ALEX:  Great . Shall we go alone or as part of the group ?
BLAKE:  Why not travel by ourselves ?
ALEX: Hello . This is John ’ s Distribution . Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I need some ice water delivered .
ALEX:  Are you completely out ?
BLAKE:  No , I have some , but not enough for the long weekend .
ALEX:  Okay . I ’ ll send someone to deliver it for you tomorrow .
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX:  No problem .
ALEX: Please come in and sit down . I'm happy to finally meet you .
BLAKE:  Same here . I've been looking forward to this .
ALEX:  I ’ m sorry I kept you waiting so long . I'm running a little late today .
BLAKE:  No problem . That happens to all of us , it goes badly with the traffic .
ALEX:  Thank you . Can I offer you some refreshment ?
BLAKE:  Why not , thank you . A little tea would be nice .

BLAKE:  Two years .

BLAKE:  I teach at Beijing Normal University , English composition and some conversational classes .
ALEX:  Everything appears to be in order . Thank you for your time .
ALEX: Do you wash clothes here often ?
BLAKE:  I have been coming here for the past few years .
ALEX:  Why do you wash here ?
BLAKE:  It's actually a lot cheaper for me to wash my clothes here .
ALEX:  I've only washed my clothes here a couple times .
BLAKE:  Why don't you wash clothes at home ?
ALEX:  I would , if my washing machine wasn't broken .
BLAKE:  Why don't you just get it fixed ?
ALEX:  I can't afford it .
BLAKE:  So you plan on washing your clothes here from now on ?
ALEX:  That's my only option right now .
BLAKE:  Don't worry . Besides , it's a lot cheaper to wash clothes this way .
ALEX: Francis , you have done an outstanding work in the past six months . In view of your achievement , I trust you ’ re now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title .
BLAKE:  I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company .
ALEX:  This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you .
BLAKE:  Thank you , I will be doing my best .
ALEX: I've brought this dress back to exchange it .
BLAKE:  That's not a problem . Leave it with me , and find something that you like .
ALEX:  I was hoping you'd have something on sale today .
BLAKE:  We have nothing on sale today . But we're having a big sale next weekend .
ALEX:  Is the sale going to include dresses ?
BLAKE:  Everything you can see will be on sale .
ALEX:  I like the sound of that . I'll just come back next weekend .
BLAKE:  The savings will be worth the short wait . See you next weekend .
ALEX: Good afternoon , sir.What Can I do for you ?
BLAKE:  Well . I can't find my key now . I think I have lost it .
ALEX:  Really ? Have you left it in your room ?
BLAKE:  I don't think so . I took it with me when I went out this morning .
ALEX:  Well , in that case , you have to pay for it . Please fill out the form first .
ALEX: How are you today ?
BLAKE:  Very well .
ALEX:  Do you need help with something ?
BLAKE:  I need to make a transfer .
ALEX:  What account would you like to transfer the money from ?
BLAKE:  I want to transfer money from my savings account .
ALEX:  Where do you want the money to go to ?
BLAKE:  I want the money to be transferred into my checking account .
ALEX:  How much money are you going to transfer today ?
BLAKE:  $ 200 will be fine .
ALEX:  Is that all I can do for you today ?
BLAKE:  I won ’ t be needing anything else .
ALEX: Do you like the room ?
BLAKE:  Yes . What is the rent ?
ALEX:  $ 300 per month .
BLAKE:  Then what's the rent due date ?
ALEX:  At the beginning of the month . Besides , you should pay me $ 1000 as deposit .
ALEX: I'd like to talk to Mr . White please ?
BLAKE:  He stepped out of the office for a little while .
ALEX:  When is a good time to catch him ?
BLAKE:  In about twenty minutes .
ALEX: Give me a book please , Jane .
BLAKE:  Which book ? This one ?
ALEX:  No , not that one . The red one .
BLAKE:  This one ?
ALEX:  Yes , please .
BLAKE:  Here you are .
ALEX:  Thank you .
ALEX: Do you want a shampoo ?
BLAKE:  Yes .
ALEX:  What brand do you prefer ?
BLAKE:  An ordinary one will do.Would you put me under a hot dryer after that ? I'm in a hurry .
ALEX:  All right , miss.This one is very hot . I'll come to turn it off in fifteen minutes.Will that be alright ?
BLAKE:  OK .
ALEX: Come on . Don ’ t cheat on me . It ’ s a long shot .
BLAKE:  It ’ s true . You should be happy about that .
ALEX: I can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month .
BLAKE:  It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax .
ALEX:  Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves .
BLAKE:  Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
ALEX:  Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
ALEX: What should I do to prepare for a job interview ?
BLAKE:  An understanding of the basic workings of a company and the services or goods it provides is essential . Do you have that ?
ALEX:  Sort of , but I could know more , I guess .
BLAKE:  With that understanding , you can figure out what your company is looking for in terms of basic attitude . Right ?
ALEX:  I think that they are a very formal company .
BLAKE:  What you wear is important . So keep in mind what is suitable for the company and type of work you will be doing . Need help ?
ALEX:  I need a lot of help in this area .
BLAKE:  In addition to clothes we need to think about other basics , OK ?
ALEX:  Yes , what else should we think of ?
BLAKE:  Be prompt . Don't forget to be friendly and interested . Listen carefully and listen to what they are really asking you . You'll be a hit !
ALEX: What are your responsibilities as a secretary ?
BLAKE:  I did only simple things in the office , such as tidying up the office , serving tea , typing and filing , and so on .
ALEX:  What courses did you take in English secretarial studies ?
BLAKE:  I took such courses as Secretarial Principles , Office Administration , Business English , and Public Relations .
ALEX: Hello . Where are you headed today ?
BLAKE:  I'm off to Barcelona for a week .
ALEX:  Do you have your passport with you ?
BLAKE:  Yes , here you go . I don't need a visa to go to Spain , do I ?
ALEX:  Fortunately for you , you don't . Next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
BLAKE:  That's good advice .
ALEX:  Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
BLAKE:  Are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
ALEX:  Let me see here ... yes , there's one left .
BLAKE:  Ok . I'll take that one then .
ALEX:  Alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
BLAKE:  I like to travel light so I just have this one .
ALEX:  If that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?
BLAKE:  Yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ?
ALEX:  You're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . Here's your boarding pass . Enjoy your flight !
ALEX: All right . I want to bring everybody in on this project . When can we start working on this ?
BLAKE:  Well , we could probably get started with a strategy meeting tomorrow morning at 8
ALEX:  I tell you what , 800 is no good for me , but why don ’ t you guys get started and I ’ ll come by at around 8
BLAKE:  That ’ s fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ?
ALEX: I need a pan .
BLAKE:  Okay . Do you have a particular size in mind ?
ALEX:  Well , the bigger the better , I think .
BLAKE:  Look at this one . It's our biggest pan .
ALEX:  Yes , that is big enough , but it's too heavy for me .
BLAKE:  Okay , we have the same thing in aluminum .
ALEX:  Oh , this is nice and light . But it has an aluminum handle .
BLAKE:  Try this one . Same aluminum pan , but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle .
ALEX:  Oh , yes . This is very nice . I'll take this one .
BLAKE:  That's a good choice . How do you want to pay for it ?
ALEX:  Cash . Oh , I almost forgot . I need a lid , too .
BLAKE:  I'm so sorry . A lid comes with the pan . Here it is .
ALEX: Well , Mr . Smith . That ’ s a nasty infection you have .
BLAKE:  Yes . Is there anything you can give me to get rid of it , Doctor ?
ALEX:  I ’ m going to prescribe some antibiotics , and some cream to ease the itching and burning .
BLAKE:  OK . Thank you . Where should I buy them ?
ALEX:  The pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic .
BLAKE:  Great . What floor is the pharmacy on ?
ALEX:  The fourth . I ’ ll send the prescription down there , so you can just pick it up on your way out .
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX: Our factory locates at a village in the east of the city . The area of it is 3,600 square meters .
BLAKE:  We'd like to visit the factory . Can you show me the way ?
ALEX:  That's OK ! We'll take you to have a tour . Please follow me .
BLAKE:  How many shifts are there in your factory ?
ALEX:  There are two shifts now in total .
BLAKE:  What about your company's QC management ?
ALEX:  We established the strict QC standards and we have followed it for about five years with good results .
BLAKE:  Where are the workers from ? From the villages nearby ?
ALEX:  Most of them live in the city . We provide free commuter buses for the workers . Besides , we built the dormitory building for the workers on night shift .
BLAKE:  It sounds nice . We can't wait to visiting the factory .
ALEX: My toothache started nearly a month ago . The pain's been keeping me awake . Would you please have a look ?
BLAKE:  Open your mouth , please . Which one ?
ALEX:  The one right at the back .
BLAKE:  I'm afraid we can ’ t save that one . It will have to come out .
ALEX:  Will it hurt much ?
BLAKE:  I'll give you an injection , then you won't feel pain .
ALEX:  ( 5 minutes later ) OK , it's all over . Spit there and bite the cotton ball tightly in place for half an hour .
ALEX: It's raining heavily .
BLAKE:  We have to find a shelter .
ALEX:  All right .
BLAKE:  Let's go under the tree .
ALEX:  No , we can't . It's thundering .
BLAKE:  Then let's go to that store .
ALEX: Hi , I want to check out . Here is my room key .
BLAKE:  One second , sir , while I print out your receipt . Here you are .
ALEX:  Thanks .
BLAKE:  May I ask , sir , if you enjoyed your stay ?

BLAKE:  Thank you for your honesty . I assure you there will be no cockroaches next time .
ALEX: Have you attended school today ?
BLAKE:  I attended school today . Did you ?
ALEX:  I wasn't able to attend school because I was feeling ill .
BLAKE:  I'm sorry to hear that . Would you like the assignments from English class ?
ALEX:  I would really appreciate that , thanks .
BLAKE:  It's no trouble at all .
ALEX:  If you get sick , I'll return the favor .
BLAKE:  Thanks . See you at school tomorrow if you feel better .

BLAKE:  I understand .
ALEX: Well , Mr . Smith . That's a nasty infection you have .
BLAKE:  Yes . Is there anything you can give me to get rid of it , doctor ?
ALEX:  I'm going to prescribe some antibiotics and some cream to ease the itching and burning .
BLAKE:  Ok , thank you ! Where should I buy them ?
ALEX:  The pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic .
BLAKE:  Great ! What floor is pharmacy on ?

BLAKE:  Thank you !
ALEX: How can I help you ?
BLAKE:  well , I'm looking for some summer clothes .
ALEX:  Oh , it is the right time for you purchasing in our clothes shop . We are now having a low price on all our summer apparel .
BLAKE:  Really ? What's that ?
ALEX:  Everything for summer is 20 % off .
BLAKE:  I like this T-shirt . Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with it ?
ALEX:  Sure . We have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the T-shirt . Look at this section .
BLAKE:  This one is good .
ALEX:  You have good taste . It is very much in style this year .
BLAKE:  I'll take this one . How much are they ?
ALEX:  160 yuan .
BLAKE:  Here you are .
ALEX: What are you having for lunch ?
BLAKE:  I got a sandwich , some chips , and a soda .
ALEX:  Did you bring that from home ?
BLAKE:  I got it from the cafeteria .
ALEX:  What kind of sandwich did you get ?
BLAKE:  They messed up my order and gave me a bologna sandwich .
ALEX:  How was it ?
BLAKE:  Considering it wasn't what I ordered , it was still pretty good .
ALEX:  I think I got a sandwich there once before .
BLAKE:  Really ?
ALEX:  Yes , and they didn't get my order right either .
ALEX: Could you project what you would like to be doing five years from now ?
BLAKE:  As I have some administrative experience from my last job , I may use my organizational and planning skills in the future .
ALEX:  How do you plan to accomplish this ?
BLAKE:  By doing everything necessary and for further study .
ALEX:  How long would you like to stay with this company ?
BLAKE:  How long I will stay with the company depends on whether the company and I are satisfied with each other .
ALEX:  What do you think of this industry's outlook in five years ?
BLAKE:  I do believe this industry will be developed rapidly in 5 years time .
ALEX: Hello ? This is John Smith.Can I speak to Mr.White , please ?
BLAKE:  This is Mr.White speaking .
ALEX:  Hi . I understand that you have a house for sale , haven ’ t you ?
BLAKE:  Yes .

ALEX:  OK . I will be there .
BLAKE:  Thank you for calling.Goodbye .
ALEX:  Bye .
ALEX: Hey , Jim , you're 15 minutes late . What's up ?
BLAKE:  I got stuck in a traffic jam .
ALEX:  Hurry up , the show is about to start .
BLAKE:  It looks like you're very interested in the circus .
ALEX:  Yes , I love to see the animal show .
BLAKE:  I have never seen those before , but since you're so excited it should be good .
ALEX:  I'm sure you'll love it .
BLAKE:  Okay , I will go and get some popcorn first .
ALEX: May I have a cookie ?
BLAKE:  Help yourself .
ALEX: What's the matter ?
BLAKE:  Checking out , please .
ALEX:  Can I have your keys , please ? Thank you . Here's your statement .
BLAKE:  Excuse me . What are these charges ?
ALEX:  Oh , these are the phone charges and these are for something from the bar .
BLAKE:  Wait a minute . I made a phone call , but I never made a connection .
ALEX:  I know , sir . Those aren't telephone company charges . Those are hotel charges .
BLAKE:  Isn't that a bit excessive ?
ALEX:  I'm sorry , sir . It's our policy .
BLAKE:  OK . Here is the money .
ALEX:  Thank you . Welcome to our hotel again .
ALEX: Can I help you , sir ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I'd like to look at some suits .
ALEX:  Oh , this way please . What size do you wear ?
BLAKE:  Size 41 . I want something in dark flannel .
ALEX:  How about this one ?
BLAKE:  It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I'd like it better . This seems too light for winter . Do you think you could get me one ?
ALEX:  All right . I'll show you something darker . Do you like this one ?
BLAKE:  It looks good . But can I try it on ?
ALEX:  Of course . Let me help you .
BLAKE:  Thanks . It's comfortable . Well , how much is it , please ?
ALEX:  $ 280 .
BLAKE:  Ok . I'll take it . Here's the money .
ALEX: Mike , you're seventeen years old , right ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , Why ?
ALEX:  You look quite mature beside your cousin who is eighteen .
BLAKE:  You can bet on that .
ALEX: Come in and sit down .
BLAKE:  Thanks , Mr . Liang .
ALEX:  Among all the assistants , I think you're on top of it . Based on the annual evaluation , the board of directors decided to give you a bonus .
BLAKE:  Really ? I am too happy .
ALEX:  I've been reviewing your work over the past few months . Thanks to your excellent work , we benefit much from your project . And you should get the perfect attendance award too .
BLAKE:  Thanks for your trust . Owing to my colleagues ' help , I've successfully completed my task .
ALEX:  You are very modest and diligent . The distribution of bonus derived from the performance evaluation . You deserve it .
BLAKE:  Thank you very much . I will redouble my efforts in the future .
ALEX: Donna ! How are you ? It's good to hear your voice .
BLAKE:  Thank you . Jack , it's always a pleasure doing business with you .
ALEX:  So how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave ?
BLAKE:  Great ! And , how are things in your neck of the woods ?
ALEX:  Things are so great here . I almost smiled myself to death last week . One of my coworkers had to give me CPR .
BLAKE:  Oh.Jack , I have missed your sense of humor.Ha ha ha ! Nobody else sees things quite like you do.It ' s your gift .
ALEX:  Or a curse .
BLAKE:  Nope , it's a gift.Anyway , we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time .
ALEX:  That , my dear , was classic sales technique delivered by a professional .
BLAKE:  Are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit ?
ALEX:  Heck no , we doubled the price , but because it's you , I'll let you have'em at 50 off .
BLAKE:  You silver-tongued devil . Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ?
ALEX:  I could , but where's the fun in that ?
ALEX: Hi . I ’ m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delay.How long of a delay is expected ?
BLAKE:  So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case .
ALEX:  Do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ?
BLAKE:  I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ?
ALEX:  What seems to be the problem ?
BLAKE:  It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry .
ALEX:  Umm ... You know ... Actually I was thinking of trying another airline . No need to hold my seat .
ALEX: I need to go to the ATM .
BLAKE:  So , why don ’ t you ?
ALEX:  I have no idea how to use the ATM .
BLAKE:  What do you mean ?
ALEX:  This will be my first time using an ATM .
BLAKE:  I can help you with that .
ALEX:  Explain to me how to use it .
BLAKE:  Just put your card into the machine .
ALEX:  Now what do I do ?
BLAKE:  Then you need to type in your PIN .
ALEX:  Now what ?
BLAKE:  Just click on one of the choices they give you , and that ’ s it .
ALEX: Would you like something to drink ?
BLAKE:  Yes please . Do you have any teas ?
ALEX:  Of course we have lots of teas ?
BLAKE:  What do you recommend ?
ALEX:  What about a green tea or perhaps a jasmine tea ?
BLAKE:  What ’ s this one ?
ALEX:  That ’ s Oolong tea – it ’ s a Cantonese tea .
BLAKE:  Ok , I ’ ll try that .
ALEX: May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ?
BLAKE:  Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing !
ALEX:  Why are they all in glass boxes ?
BLAKE:  For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .
ALEX:  So there isn't air in the glass boxes ?
BLAKE:  No , there isn't . They are all vacuumed .
ALEX:  I wonder how old these things are , thousands of years ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time .
ALEX:  Hey , look at the three-leg cup . I've seen it on TV .
BLAKE:  The bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless !
ALEX:  Yeah , it has no value at all . Who will use this cup today ?
BLAKE:  Danny , priceless means so valuable that you can't put a price on it .
ALEX:  Oh , it does ?
ALEX: I am so worried about this English contest . I have butterflies in my stomach now !
BLAKE:  I have confidence in you . Believe in yourself .
ALEX: What would you like on your pizzas ?
BLAKE:  We want one vegetarian supreme and one double pepperoni .
ALEX:  Would you like anything to drink with that ? For $ 1.50 , you can get a two-liter bottle of Coke .
BLAKE:  No , thanks .
ALEX:  All right . That'll be $ 12.50 . Your pizzas will be there in 30 minutes .
BLAKE:  Thanks .
ALEX: We are redecorating and I'm going to add some things .
BLAKE:  Well , I'll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office .
ALEX:  Shall we meet at 1:15 this Thursday ? We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .
BLAKE:  Fine , I'll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday .
ALEX: Can you tell me the way to library ?
BLAKE:  Sure , turn left at the next crossing .
ALEX:  Is it on Xinhua street ?
BLAKE:  Yes . You can't miss it .
ALEX: Comfort Inn , may I help you ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m looking for a hotel near the convention center .
ALEX:  You ’ re in luck ! We ’ re just a two-minute drive from there . Would you like to make a reservation ?
BLAKE:  Not just yet . I have one or two questions . How much for a single ?
ALEX:  During the peak season , a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night . But we ’ Ve got a Single Super Saver Special going on right now – only $ 30 a night . And we ’ Ve also extended our checkout time 00 in
BLAKE:  That ’ s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients .
ALEX:  Yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . We can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . Of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking
BLAKE:  That sounds great . Do you accept checks ?
ALEX:  I ’ m sorry , sir , we don ’ t . But we do accept all major credit cards .
ALEX: I am sorry to trouble you , but there's a lot of noise in the next room .
BLAKE:  Oh , is there ? Which room is it ?
ALEX:  It's . I think , neighbours on the right .
BLAKE:  You mean the room thirteen-thirteen ?
ALEX:  I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhausted , but I can't sleep .
BLAKE:  All right , ma'am . I'll check and tell them to be quiet .
ALEX:  If next room is still noisy , could you give me a different room , please ?
ALEX: Have you ever been to Xi ’ an ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I ’ Ve been there several times on business trips . But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city .
ALEX:  I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place .
BLAKE:  I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening .
ALEX:  Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ?
BLAKE:  Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train .
ALEX: A ticket to London , please .
BLAKE:  A cheap day return ticket ?
ALEX:  Yes , including London Tube .
BLAKE:  That'll be twelve pounds .
ALEX: Doctor , what is the best way to stay healthy ?
BLAKE:  Having a good diet is probably the most important thing .
ALEX:  It is very confusing to know what to eat .
BLAKE:  You need plenty of fruits and vegetables , small amounts of protein , and whole grains .
ALEX:  Are there certain things that I should avoid ?
BLAKE:  You shouldn ’ t consume too much sugar or caffeine . Also , watch your intake of fatty food .
ALEX:  After watching my diet , what else should I do ?
BLAKE:  You need to stop smoking , and make sure that you get 30 minutes of exercise every day .
ALEX:  Can I have a glass of wine now and then ?
BLAKE:  As long as you don ’ t overdo it , a glass of wine a day should be OK .
ALEX: Darling , I am back . What are you doing ?
BLAKE:  I am washing clothes . Are you hungry now ? Wait for a moment , I'll cook dinner for you . ( Steven bends his brows )
ALEX:  B , should we get a maid ?
BLAKE:  I can do all the housework . We don't need a maid .
ALEX:  You have worked very hard in the office . If we can get someone to help you , you can have more rest .
BLAKE:  We really don't need to .
ALEX:  You are a good wife , Julia . But you must take care of yourself .
BLAKE:  Give me some time to think about it .
ALEX: Can I reserve a room from the 13th to the 18th ?
BLAKE:  Certainly . How do you like your room ?
ALEX:  I'd like a suite . What's the rate ?
BLAKE:  $ 40 per night .
ALEX: Is there anything I can do for you ?
BLAKE:  Excuse me , can I change my order ? I am afraid I don't have so much time to enjoy my dinner .
ALEX:  I am sorry , sir . Your fish will be ready in five minutes so you can't change it .
BLAKE:  That's all right .
ALEX: Have you graduated now ?
BLAKE:  Yes . I graduated this past June .
ALEX:  Which university did you graduate from ?
BLAKE:  Guangzhou University .
ALEX:  What degree did you receive ?
BLAKE:  I received a bachelor's degree in Economics .
ALEX:  What courses did you take in college ?
BLAKE:  My major courses were Microeconomics , Macroeconomics , International Trade , International Finance , World Economy , Psychology and Business English
ALEX:  Why did you choose to study Economics ?
BLAKE:  Because I was quite interested in Economics then .
ALEX:  Can you speak other languages except English ?
BLAKE:  I can also speak a little Japanese .
ALEX:  I am very satisfied with your answers .
BLAKE:  Thank you very much .
ALEX: Once you arrive at the American airport , please call me .
BLAKE:  OK , don ’ t worry about it . I will .
ALEX:  Take care of yourself .
ALEX: Sorry , Mary , I can't make it in time for dinner .
BLAKE:  Okay , Bob , when will I see you ?
ALEX:  Maybe I will be around later .
BLAKE:  Okay , I'll see you later .
ALEX: I am sorry , sir . I have broken the reading lamp in my room .
BLAKE:  Well , sir . May I have your room number ?
ALEX:  503 . I would like to pay for it .
BLAKE:  Please fill out the form first .
ALEX:  OK , can you bring me a new one ?
BLAKE:  Of course .
ALEX: Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription .
BLAKE:  It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
ALEX:  Yes , I need to refill it today .
BLAKE:  Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice .
ALEX:  I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not .
BLAKE:  Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
ALEX:  Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ?
BLAKE:  I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out .
ALEX:  But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription .
BLAKE:  Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never .
ALEX:  But I have a prescription . I just need more of it .
BLAKE:  A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
ALEX:  Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
BLAKE:  Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry .
ALEX:  This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it .
BLAKE:  Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too .
ALEX: What are you doing ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m trying to put the vase on the shelf .
ALEX:  Let regive you a hand .
BLAKE:  No , thank you . I can manage it , I think .
ALEX: There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose .
BLAKE:  Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
ALEX:  I'd rather get one with separated speakers.They give a clear sound .
BLAKE:  Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
ALEX:  That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony .
BLAKE:  Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration .
ALEX: Ahhchooo !
BLAKE:  You've been sneezing a lot lately . Are you sick or something ?
ALEX:  No . Every spring time around April , I'm stricken with allergies .
BLAKE:  I never have seasonal allergies .
ALEX:  Consider yourself lucky .
BLAKE:  What are all the symptoms ?
ALEX:  Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water .
BLAKE:  That doesn't sound good .
ALEX:  No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ?
BLAKE:  Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family .
ALEX:  Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol .
BLAKE:  I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body .
ALEX:  That's pretty bad .
BLAKE:  But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah .
ALEX: Let's have a look at the map first .
BLAKE:  All right . Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here .
ALEX:  Let's buy some tickets .
BLAKE:  The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train
ALEX:  Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ?
BLAKE:  No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them .
ALEX: What do you do ?
BLAKE:  I'm an apprentice with a local engineering firm . My training lasts for two years . Two days a week I study Engineering at a local college . If I pass all my exams , I hope the company will take me on as an engineer .
ALEX: I want to keep a pet , but I don't know which one to buy ?
BLAKE:  Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day .
ALEX:  Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then .
BLAKE:  What about cats ? They are more independent .
ALEX:  Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat .
BLAKE:  How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ?
ALEX:  Yeah , are they easy to look after ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything .
ALEX: Can I be of any service to you ?
BLAKE:  I've been told that Chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship . We'd like to take some home . What would you recommend ?
ALEX:  There are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop.For example , there is tricolored pottery originating in the Tang Dynasty , embroidery , batik , jade carving , just to name a few.Do you have anything in mind ?
BLAKE:  No , not really.But I think it should be something distinctively Chinese . And easy to carry .
ALEX:  I would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik.They are very easy to carry .
BLAKE:  So , we'd like to see some embroidery .
ALEX: Hey , Mary . We're back . Have you eaten yet ?
BLAKE:  I had some bread for breakfast .
ALEX:  Let's go out for brunch .
BLAKE:  Brunch ?
ALEX:  It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also .
BLAKE:  Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch .
ALEX: Hi , my name is Sovia.What ’ s your name ?
BLAKE:  My name is Jeff .
ALEX:  What do you do ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m a podiatrist . What about you ?
ALEX:  I ’ m a nurse.What do you do in your free time ?
BLAKE:  I like to play piano , go bowling and chat with my friends.And you ?
ALEX:  I like to hang out with my friends , play games and go swimming .
BLAKE:  Would you like to go out some time ?
ALEX:  Sure , that ’ d be great.Where would you like to go ?
BLAKE:  Anywhere with you .
ALEX:  Aren ’ t you sweet .
ALEX: Oh , I'm starving . I'd like to try some real Chinese cuisine . What would you recommend , waiter ?
BLAKE:  Well , it depends . You see , there are eight famous Chinese for instance , the Sichuan cuisine , and the Hunan cuisine .
ALEX:  They are both spicy hot , I've heard .
BLAKE:  That's right . If you like hot dishes , you could try some .
ALEX:  They might be too hot for me .
BLAKE:  Then there's the Cantonese cuisine and the Kiangsu cuisine . Most southerners like them .
ALEX:  What about any special Beijing dishes ?
BLAKE:  There's the Beijing roast duck .
ALEX:  Oh , yes . I've heard a lot about it . I'd like very much to try it . Where can I find it ?
BLAKE:  You can find it in most restaurants , but the best place is certainly Quanjude Restaurant .
ALEX:  Is it near here ?
BLAKE:  Not too near but not too far either . A taxi will take you there in 15 minutes , If the traffic is not too bad , I mean .
ALEX:  Well , thank you for your information . But what is the name of that restaurant again ?
BLAKE:  Let me write it down on this slip of paper for you . You can show it to the taxi-driver .
ALEX:  That's very kind of you . Thanks a lot .
ALEX: hi , Isaiah . How are you ?
BLAKE:  I ’ m well . And you ?
ALEX:  fine . How ’ s your job going ?
BLAKE:  I don ’ t know if I told you or not , but I decided to start my own business .
ALEX:  really ? That ’ s fantastic . What kind of business is it ?
BLAKE:  I ’ Ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from Goldman Sachs .
ALEX:  how ’ s it going ?
BLAKE:  it started off a bit slow , but now , business is really booming !
ALEX:  that ’ s such great news . I ’ m really happy for you ! Where is your office located ?
BLAKE:  our headoffice is here in Beijing , but we ’ re planning on opening up two more offices soon .
ALEX:  where will those be located ?
BLAKE:  if all goes well , we ’ ll open one up in Hong Kong in April and another one in Singapore in October .
ALEX:  when will you find out ?
BLAKE:  we ’ re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow .
ALEX:  well , good luck . I hope it all goes well for you tomorrow !
BLAKE:  thanks !
ALEX: Ant Shirley , it's being years since we last met . How were you doing in the passing years ?
BLAKE:  Pretty well . What about you ?
ALEX:  Fine . Where are the other guys ?
BLAKE:  It's a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie .
ALEX:  Bad timing . I want to see them so much . How are they ?
BLAKE:  Not bad . I heard you are going to graduate this coming summer , right ?
ALEX:  Yes , that's why I'm here . I'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment .
BLAKE:  Did you go to a real estate agent ?
ALEX:  No , that will be too expensive .
BLAKE:  That's true . By the way , what kind of apartment are you looking for ?
ALEX:  My first job's salary will be a bit low . So the cheaper the better . Just one I can afford .
BLAKE:  Sure . I'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you .
ALEX:  I'll appreciate it so much .
ALEX: Good afternoon .
BLAKE:  My goodness ! It ’ s the afternoon ? Doesn ’ t the time fly ! Do come in and sit down .
ALEX:  Thank you .
BLAKE:  What ’ s the time ? My watch has stopped .
ALEX:  It ’ s half past twelve .
BLAKE:  When do you have lunch ?
ALEX:  From one to two .
BLAKE:  What do you normally eat ?
ALEX:  We usually go to the cafeteria .
BLAKE:  Oh , it ’ s time to have lunch now .
ALEX:  let ’ s go together .
ALEX: Merry Christmas , Bill .
BLAKE:  Merry Christmas , Jina .
ALEX:  What are you doing there on the computer ?
BLAKE:  Come have a look , I received many beautiful e-cards . They are from my friends , all over the world . Christmas wishes for all my friends .
ALEX:  That's pretty interesting . Did you get one from Haven ? The reason I ask is that I am looking for her number .
BLAKE:  Sorry , I don't have it . But I do have her Email . You want me to sent it to you ?
ALEX:  Yeah , that would be great . Thanks .
BLAKE:  No worries . I just for her card . And you can get her from Email . I would really like to talk to her again . I kind of miss her a little this days .
ALEX:  Thanks million .
BLAKE:  My pleasure .
ALEX: There are so many eating utensils on the table . Which ones do I use first ?
BLAKE:  Use them from the outside in .
ALEX:  I see . A set for appetizers and another for the main course .
BLAKE:  Right . We do the same thing at home . Don't you remember ?
ALEX:  Oh yeah . The big napkin goes on my lap .
BLAKE:  Let's look at our menus .
ALEX:  Cindy , help me order because I'm still not very familiar with American cooking .
BLAKE:  Well , we order appetizers first and then entrees .
ALEX: It was nice talking to you .
BLAKE:  Why are you trying to rush me off the phone ?
ALEX:  I really have to go .
BLAKE:  Why ? I still wanted to talk to you .
ALEX:  I have things to do .
BLAKE:  Like what ?
ALEX:  Don't be nosey .
BLAKE:  I'm not . I just want to know .
ALEX:  Well , it's really none of your business .
BLAKE:  That's harsh .
ALEX:  I'm sorry , but I have to go .
BLAKE:  Fine .
ALEX: Mom , will you have time to help me with my homework today ?
BLAKE:  Sorry , I won't . I'll be working against the clock to finish my presentation .
ALEX: Well , Peter , you have to do better than that next time , won ’ t you ?
BLAKE:  Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ?
ALEX:  Of course , you have . You must try harder this time .
BLAKE:  And must I go back to school ?
ALEX:  No , you needn ’ t do that . You ’ d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes .
BLAKE:  But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ’ m nearly 17 .
ALEX:  You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study .
BLAKE:  What else I ’ Ve got to do ? Join the army ?
ALEX:  Who knows ! That might come to later .
ALEX: How do you do ?
BLAKE:  How do you do ?
ALEX:  My name is Wang Liang , I ’ m from Beijing . Where do you come from ?
BLAKE:  I come from the city of Tangshan in Hebes Province .
ALEX:  You're from Tangshan ? I can't believe my ears . I was also born in Tangshan , but I was brought up in Beijing .
BLAKE:  Really ? It's nice to meet you . How long have you been with this company ?
ALEX:  Just over 4 years now . Since this is your first day here , I'm sure you don't really know too much yet . Let me show you around , so you can introduce yourself to everyone .
BLAKE:  Oh , Thank you very much !
ALEX: Hello , Parker . How's everything ?
BLAKE:  Can't complain . And you ?
ALEX:  Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How's your schedule look ?
BLAKE:  Let me see . I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday .
ALEX:  Great .
ALEX: I like to open up a savings account please .
BLAKE:  O . K . We offer a few different kinds .
ALEX:  I want the one with the highest interest rate .
BLAKE:  That would be our Saver's Plus account .
ALEX:  4.5 % , that's good . How much money do I have to keep in it to get that rate ?
BLAKE:  You have to maintain a balance of $ 10,000 in the account or the rate drops to 3 % .
ALEX:  All right . I ’ ll open one of those .
BLAKE:  Just fill out these forms , and I ’ ll be with you in one second .
ALEX:  Thanks .
ALEX: Hi , where can I find a cheap cashmere sweater ?
BLAKE:  How about an outlet ?
ALEX:  Great idea !
BLAKE:  Outlets give good deals .
ALEX:  Thank you so much .
BLAKE:  You're welcome .
ALEX: I have difficulty with this form . Will you please explain it to me ?
BLAKE:  Actually there is a sample over there . But if you still have a problem , let me know .
ALEX:  Oh , that's great . Thank you very much .
ALEX: Do you develop films here ?
BLAKE:  Yes , we shall . What size do you like ?
ALEX:  Well , the 4 x 6 is fine .
BLAKE:  Which do you prefer , color or black and white ?
ALEX:  The last one is black and white , all the rest should need color .
BLAKE:  OK .
ALEX:  I hope they will come out well . When should I pick them up ?
BLAKE:  They will be ready at noon tomorrow . Each negative develops one print , right ?
ALEX:  Yes , it is . And develop them as glossy as possible .
BLAKE:  No problem . Do you need another film ?
ALEX:  Yes , a roll of Kodak film please .
BLAKE:  It is totally $ 20 including the deposit for films .
ALEX: How come it is slow as a snail today ?
BLAKE:  You mean the network connection ?
ALEX:  Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response for any click .
BLAKE:  I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately .
ALEX:  Ok .
ALEX: I need help . I think my arm is broken .
BLAKE:  Alright . Have you been to this hospital before ?
ALEX:  No , I haven't . I need help quick . It hurts really badly .
BLAKE:  I understand . It's good you came to the emergency room .
ALEX:  Let me see a doctor .
BLAKE:  I'm sorry , sir . You will need to wait at least a short time.We are very busy tonight . There was a big car accident on Highway 106 .
ALEX:  I thought this was the emergency room .
BLAKE:  It is . But unless you are critically injured , you still need to wait.You aren't bleeding , are you ?
ALEX:  No . Only a little . I fell off my porch .
BLAKE:  Oh , that's terrible . Is it your right arm or your left arm ?
ALEX:  My left arm .
BLAKE:  Can you fill out this form then ?
ALEX:  No , I can't . I'm left-handed .
BLAKE:  That's very inconvenient for you then.You ' ll probably have a cast on your left arm .
ALEX:  Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room .
BLAKE:  Yes , it is . But even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done.Have you ever been in an emergency room before ?
ALEX:  No . Just let me see a doctor . I'm worried about my arm .
BLAKE:  Be brave , sir . It won't be long . I will fill out the form for you . What is your name ?
ALEX:  Steve Schliessman . S C H L I E S S M A N .
BLAKE:  Alright Steve . Your social security number ?
ALEX:  349-95- 8821 .
BLAKE:  Do you have medical insurance ?
ALEX:  Yes , I do . Blue Cross .
BLAKE:  Do you have your insurance card with you ?
ALEX:  No , I don't .
BLAKE:  Well , you can call it in later . You can phone us .
ALEX:  Can I sit down now ?
BLAKE:  First I need to get your address . Try to move your arm as little as possible .
ALEX: Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice .
BLAKE:  Yes , it is . Thanks . I ’ m just surfing on the internet .
ALEX:  Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ?
BLAKE:  This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ’ m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee !
ALEX:  That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ?
BLAKE:  No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
ALEX:  So , what programs do you have on your laptop ?
BLAKE:  I ’ Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs .
ALEX:  I know you are keen on photography . It ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at a
BLAKE:  It ’ s wonderful , isn ’ t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I took recently ?
ALEX: What shall we do today ?
BLAKE:  We'd better stay in the hotel , because the tour will begin tomorrow .
ALEX:  Let's go out for some exercise , shall we ?
BLAKE:  What an excellent idea !
ALEX:  Shall we do some jogging ?
BLAKE:  OK .
ALEX:  I feel well now .
BLAKE:  Yes , some exercise is necessary for us .
ALEX:  Quite right .
ALEX: I was wondering if you need any help on your new project .
BLAKE:  Sure ! That would be great ! Are you good at writing or would you rather do the computer work ?
ALEX:  I would like to help with the computer work .
BLAKE:  Great ! We are going to be working in teams of three . Are you OK working with others ?
ALEX:  Yes , I like working like that .
BLAKE:  We will begin next Monday . Would you be available then ?
ALEX:  Yes , I can be there .
BLAKE:  Well , if you could send me your basic background information before next Monday , it would be useful .
ALEX:  OK , I will send the information to you .
BLAKE:  Well then , thanks for your help . Have a great day !
ALEX: Congratulations , Francis . Your hard working finally pays off . I am so happy for your promotion .
BLAKE:  Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it .
ALEX:  I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ?
BLAKE:  Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful .
ALEX:  How do you think if I volunteer for some work ?
BLAKE:  I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives .
ALEX: Taxi !
BLAKE:  Yes , sir . Where to ?
ALEX:  The city square , please .
BLAKE:  Are you in a hurry ?
ALEX:  Yes , I have to be there to meet a friend at 5 thirty pm . So we're sure we can get there on time ?
BLAKE:  I'm afraid not , sir . Generally we can , but you know how it is in the rush hour now .
ALEX:  I see . Here's the extra 5 $ for you if you can get me there on time .
BLAKE:  All right . I'll do my best .
ALEX:  Oh.we made it . Thank you . How much do I own you ?
BLAKE:  The reading on the kilometer is 12 $ .
ALEX:  Here's the money , keep the changes , please .
BLAKE:  Do you need a receipt ?
ALEX:  No , thank you .
ALEX: Janice , I can't find the document I was working on last month . Can you help me to look for it ?
BLAKE:  Susan , I'm sorry . Did you look up those files I requested ?
ALEX:  Yes , but I still can not find it . Maybe it is in this cabinet .
BLAKE:  I couldn't find the files you request , even though I checked all the cross-references . I don't think it's there .
ALEX:  I am sure that document was filed .
BLAKE:  Well , let me check again under a different heading .
ALEX:  Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files .
BLAKE:  Maybe that's why I couldn't find it . All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V ' .
ALEX: What would you have ?
BLAKE:  I'll try Chinese wine .
ALEX:  What about this dry red ? It's good indeed , it never goes to the head .
BLAKE:  OK . Give me one , please .
ALEX:  Here it is .
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX:  I'm always at your service .
ALEX: Are you planning on voting ?
BLAKE:  Yes . Are you ?
ALEX:  I will be voting tomorrow .
BLAKE:  What ’ s your polling place ?
ALEX:  My polling place is at the park up the street .
BLAKE:  Oh , yeah ?
ALEX:  Yeah , where is yours ?
BLAKE:  I don ’ t know .
ALEX:  How is it you don ’ t know ?
BLAKE:  The location of my polling place never came in the mail .
ALEX:  You can always just check online .
BLAKE:  Let me go do that .
ALEX: I am sorry , I have broken my wine glass , and would you please bring me another ?
BLAKE:  Sure . I will clean the glasses for you .
ALEX:  Thank you . Where is the washing room ?
BLAKE:  Walk straight and turn left .
ALEX: What's wrong , officer ?
BLAKE:  You do realize that you ran a red light , don't you ?
ALEX:  I did ?
BLAKE:  You didn't see the red light ?
ALEX:  I'm sorry for running it , but I really didn't know .
BLAKE:  Didn't you learn that red means stop ?
ALEX:  I know that .
BLAKE:  Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light .
ALEX:  I'm not sure .
BLAKE:  I'm giving you a ticket for this .
ALEX:  I'm sorry for the misunderstanding .
BLAKE:  Maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light .
ALEX: Medicine Industry , this is Peter Bush speaking , can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Good afternoon , could you connect this call with Mr Brown , please
ALEX:  May I know who's calling ?
BLAKE:  This is Li Ping of ABC computer company limited . I'm calling on our Mr Wilson the general manager of our company .
ALEX:  I'm sorry , Mrs Li , Mr Brown is now in a meeting.May I have your number , and ask him to call you back later ?
BLAKE:  I'm afraid Mr Wilson would like to speak to Mr Brown right now.He ' s got an urgent matter to discuss with Mr Brown without delay .
ALEX:  Ok , then would you please hold the line ? Mr Li , the line is through , Mr Brown is ready answering the call , go ahead .
BLAKE:  Thank you for your assistance , Mr Bush .
ALEX:  You are welcome .
ALEX: Mr . Li , I come to remind you of the meeting scheduled at 11 o'clock this morning .
BLAKE:  Oh , that's right . And the general manager asked me to report the company's sales for last year at the meeting .
ALEX:  By the way , the meeting will be held in your office .
BLAKE:  OK , thank you very much .
ALEX:  Not at all . That's what I should do .
ALEX: Bob , would you come and help me ?
BLAKE:  Of course . What do you want me to do , Mom ?
ALEX:  Could you hold these packages while I look for the key ?
BLAKE:  Alright , what's in them ? They are so heavy !
ALEX:  Just things we need for the picnic tomorrow .
BLAKE:  Well , hurry up and open the door please . I told you these things are heavy .
ALEX:  I'm sorry , but I just can't find the key . You must have it .
BLAKE:  Oh , yes , it's in my pocket . But how can I get the key while I'm holding all these bags ?
ALEX: Excuse me . My name is Dan Ford . I have an appointment with the dentist at 3:30 .
BLAKE:  Yes , Mr . Ford . The dentist will be ready to see you in a minute . Have a seat .
ALEX:  Thank you .
ALEX: Isn't it past your bedtime already ?
BLAKE:  I am not sleepy .
ALEX:  It's getting late , and you have to wake up early tomorrow .
BLAKE:  There is no way that I can fall asleep right now .
ALEX:  Try listening to some soft music .
BLAKE:  It won't work . I'm nowhere close to being tired .
ALEX:  I really don't care , just go to sleep .
BLAKE:  What if I stay up and do something , until I get tired ?
ALEX:  You'll be up all night if I let you do that .
BLAKE:  I'm going to get to sleep eventually .
ALEX:  You need to go to sleep now , so go to sleep .
BLAKE:  Good night .
ALEX: I want to go try on these clothes .
BLAKE:  What did you find ?
ALEX:  I found some jeans , and a new blouse .
BLAKE:  Go and try it on .
ALEX:  What do you think ?
BLAKE:  I love that shirt on you .
ALEX:  What about the jeans ?
BLAKE:  They don't really fit you right .
ALEX:  I don't think so either .
BLAKE:  That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though .
ALEX:  Well , I'll just buy the shirt .
BLAKE:  That would be a good idea .
ALEX: Now , Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I ’ Ve had the chance to look it over and I must say I ’ m quite impressed .
BLAKE:  Thank you very much . I ’ Ve tried to keep it short and clear . If there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me .
ALEX:  Well yes , I do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
BLAKE:  Yes , of course . Well as you can see from the resume I ’ m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , although our family moved to London when I was quite young , at around sixteen .
ALEX:  Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ?
BLAKE:  Yes precisely . Although I was born in the US , I would definitely call London home . But as you see I ’ Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . My Father was in the oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia too .
ALEX:  Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .
BLAKE:  Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ’ m really looking to settle down .
ALEX:  I see . okay , well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
ALEX: Can you tell me , Ms . Smith , about the training programs you initiated this year ?
BLAKE:  We ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained .
ALEX:  What ’ s the result ?
BLAKE:  We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received .
ALEX:  That seems very impressive . Good work !
BLAKE:  Thank you , but I cannot take all the credit . Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level .
ALEX: Well , good morning , Tom . I haven't seen you for a long time .
BLAKE:  I'd been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago .
ALEX:  What seems to be the trouble now ?
BLAKE:  I feel run down , tired . I've been having headaches almost every day . And I'm not getting as much sleep as usually do .
ALEX:  Have you been eating properly ? Eating the right kind of food is important for your health , you know .
BLAKE:  Well , I haven't been eating well , I guess . I usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch .
ALEX:  And what about dinner ?
BLAKE:  Sometimes I'm too tired to eat anything at all .
ALEX:  That's not good . You don't have a well-balanced diet . Have you been taking vitamin pills ?
BLAKE:  I don't like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first .
ALEX: Thank you for purchasing your new mattress with us .
BLAKE:  No , thank you .
ALEX:  Would you like us to deliver the mattress for you , sir ?
BLAKE:  That would be great .
ALEX:  When do you want it delivered ?
BLAKE:  I need it delivered tomorrow . Will that be possible ?
ALEX:  What time exactly ?
BLAKE:  I need it delivered at 12 o'clock .
ALEX:  We can have it to you at that time .
BLAKE:  That's not a problem ?
ALEX:  We will deliver your mattress tomorrow at 12 o'clock .
BLAKE:  That's great ! Thank you very much .
ALEX: Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I'm looking for a house .
ALEX:  To buy or to rent ?
BLAKE:  Oh , to rent .
ALEX:  How much do you want to pay ?
BLAKE:  About 300 a month .
ALEX:  Well , I've got one here . It's 260 a month .
BLAKE:  How big is it ?
ALEX:  It's got a kitchen , a bathroom , and one bedroom .
BLAKE:  Well , actually I prefer something a bit bigger if that's possible .
ALEX:  Yes , I think so . There is also an interesting one.It ' s opposite the park .
BLAKE:  How much is it ?
ALEX:  It's 325 a month . It's the biggest we've got in this area .
BLAKE:  What's it like ?
ALEX:  Well , There're two bedrooms , a sitting room , a kitchen and a bathroom .
BLAKE:  It sounds interesting . Can I go and see it ?
ALEX:  Of course , Sir .
ALEX: Would you please mail these letters , Lucy ?
BLAKE:  Yes , Sir .
ALEX:  These two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . Others are ordinary letters .
BLAKE:  All right , who should I send them to ?
ALEX:  It ’ s sent to Mr . Charles . I believe he is in London .
BLAKE:  Ok , home or office address ?
ALEX:  Office address , please . He might be at work when they arrive .
BLAKE:  Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
ALEX:  Yes , it ’ s right .
ALEX: What are you reading ?
BLAKE:  Oh , it ’ s the latest novel by Ray Blue . It ’ s a sic-fi thriller .
ALEX:  I thought he usually wrote horror books .
BLAKE:  He does . He ’ s good at this genre too . It ’ s a captivating read .
ALEX:  We ’ re going to the bookshop . Would you like to join us ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I would . I need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , I love browsing through the latest paperbacks .
ALEX:  Me too . I need something to read on the flight to New York . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ’ s books for her daughter .
BLAKE:  I want to look at nelson Mandela ’ s autobiography .
ALEX:  This is sure to be a worthwhile read .
ALEX: Doctor , I have the worst toothache !
BLAKE:  How long have you had this pain ?
ALEX:  For about a week or so , but it ’ s gotten really bad in the last couple of days .
BLAKE:  Did you do anything that might have aggravated your tooth ?
ALEX:  You know , I was eating jawbreakers in the movies the other day , and I accidentally bit down really hard on one .
BLAKE:  What kind of toothbrush do you use ?
ALEX:  I just use a regular hard bristle toothbrush .
BLAKE:  Does it bother you when you eat something really cold ?
ALEX:  Yes , it definitely bothers me more when I do that .
ALEX: Good evening .
BLAKE:  Good evening.My wife and I would like a room , please.Is there any room available ? We don't have a reservation .
ALEX:  Let me see.Yes , we have one room left.You ' re lucky.It ' s the last one .
BLAKE:  Good.We ' re tired after driving all day , and we're looking forward to relaxing in a comfortable room .
ALEX:  This room has two double beds.It ' s number 56 at the rear of the motel.It ' s quite a comfortable room .
BLAKE:  How much is it for one night ? We only need it for tonight.We ' re going to continue our trip in the morning .
ALEX:  It's forty-five dollars a night for two.Is anyone else traveling with you ?
BLAKE:  No , it's just the two of us .
ALEX:  Would you like to pay for the room in cash or with a credit card ?
BLAKE:  Credit card.We don't like to carry much cash with us on our trips .
ALEX:  Please fill out this registration card.Here is your key.You can park your car in front of our room.Check - out time is noon .
BLAKE:  Thank you very much .
ALEX:  Thank you , sir.Enjoy your stay with us .
ALEX: Let's go to the animal shelter .
BLAKE:  What do you want to do ?
ALEX:  I want to get a puppy for my son .
BLAKE:  That will make him so happy .
ALEX:  I'll get him one of those little dogs .
BLAKE:  One that won't grow up too big .
ALEX:  And eat too much .
BLAKE:  Do you know which one he would like ?
ALEX:  Oh , yes , I took him there yesterday . He showed me one that he really liked .
BLAKE:  I bet you had to drag him away .
ALEX:  He wanted to take it home yesterday .
BLAKE:  I wonder what he'll name it .
ALEX: Hello . I want to send the computer to my sister in Shanghai by logistics transport .
BLAKE:  OK . Is it in the box ? May I see it ?
ALEX:  Yes . This is the computer and this is the keyboard and the monitor .
BLAKE:  Is there anything else ?
ALEX:  There are a mouse and a camera .
BLAKE:  Is that all ?
ALEX:  Yes . How much is it to send these things to Shanghai by regular delivery ?
BLAKE:  It depends on the weight of these things . Generally speaking , we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram .
ALEX:  I see . Can you weigh them for me , please ?
BLAKE:  Please go over there to weigh them .
ALEX:  OK . See you later .
ALEX: what happened ? Why didn't he win ?
BLAKE:  didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .
ALEX:  how did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
BLAKE:  if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .
ALEX:  what ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
BLAKE:  he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
ALEX:  I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
BLAKE:  they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
ALEX:  that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
BLAKE:  I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
ALEX:  regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
BLAKE:  I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
ALEX:  let's hope so .
ALEX: I need to use the ATM .
BLAKE:  What ’ s stopping you ?
ALEX:  I ’ m not sure how .
BLAKE:  I don ’ t understand .
ALEX:  I ’ Ve never used one before .
BLAKE:  I can help you figure it out .
ALEX:  What do I have to do ?
BLAKE:  Slide your card into the machine .
ALEX:  Then what ?
BLAKE:  You need to type your PIN in .
ALEX:  What do I have to do next ?
BLAKE:  Click on whichever option you want , and you ’ re done .
ALEX: What are you doing ? Checking the " to do " list for the wedding ?
BLAKE:  Yep . There's still so much to do !
ALEX:  So let's start by checking off what we've already done .
BLAKE:  Did you reconfirm the plane reservations for all the Taiwanese guests ?
ALEX:  Not yet , I was busy getting that videographer who films stuff for the Net .
BLAKE:  Cool ! I can't believe he agreed to go all the way to Dallas with us !
ALEX:  Hey ! We're paying for his ticket !
ALEX: It is my first time coming to China . I want to buy something unique of China to my friends as gifts .
BLAKE:  We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain . Do you like them ?
ALEX:  Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them .
BLAKE:  You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ?
ALEX:  Sounds good . May I have a look ?
BLAKE:  Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on .
ALEX:  They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs .
BLAKE:  All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality .
ALEX:  Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ?
BLAKE:  This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac .
ALEX:  Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones .
BLAKE:  OK , I will wrap them for you .
ALEX: Can you make out what he's saying ?
BLAKE:  No , it's too loud in here .
ALEX: Excuse me .
BLAKE:  Yes ?
ALEX:  Can you tell me the way to the Peak Tram , please ?
BLAKE:  Certainly . Go along Queen's Road ...
ALEX:  Along Queen's Road ...
BLAKE:  Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel .
ALEX:  Right at the Hilton .
BLAKE:  Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral .
ALEX:  The Cathedral ?
BLAKE:  Yes . Then cross the road at the next traffic lights . The Peak Tram is straight ahead . You can't miss it .
ALEX:  That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ?
BLAKE:  Yes . Why ?
ALEX:  Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down .
ALEX: Hi , Nally , are you hungry ?
BLAKE:  I'm starving . Let's go grab a bite .
ALEX:  Where to ?
BLAKE:  How about Karlis ?
ALEX:  Are you kidding ? That place is too ritzy for lunch .
BLAKE:  True . ok Let's go to Grumose ?
ALEX:  Same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg .
BLAKE:  I guess it is a little pricy .
ALEX:  Let's stop it at Multicolor for a quick lunch ..
BLAKE:  That will be Ok . Come on , I can't wait to chow down .
ALEX:  That was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy .
BLAKE:  Is that why you stiffed the waiter ?
ALEX:  You got it . All right , Let's go back to school .
ALEX: Good morning , sir .
BLAKE:  Good morning . I'd like a business suit made with this material .
ALEX:  Do you have a particular style in mind ?
BLAKE:  The kind that never goes out of fashion , I guess .
ALEX:  I think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes .
BLAKE:  I'm sure you're right . I just dread the idea of making a new suit every year .
ALEX:  The changes are usually not that dramatic . We just got some pictures of the latest fashion . Would you like to take a look ?
BLAKE:  Good . I think I'll choose this single breasted one . When can I get it ?
ALEX:  Next Friday .
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX: Oh , gosh ! I feel everything around me is against me .
BLAKE:  Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 .
ALEX:  Well , I am all ears . Maybe they are helpful .
BLAKE:  Firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . And secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . The last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age .
ALEX:  I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it .
BLAKE:  Good luck to us .
ALEX: Look , Mary ! There are so many people over there !
BLAKE:  Oh , I remember , there is a job fair in the personnel market .
ALEX:  I have never been to the personnel market .
BLAKE:  Really ? I have been there several times .
ALEX:  Are there many employers ?
BLAKE:  Yes . The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers .
ALEX:  So there will be many large companies in the personnel market , right ?
BLAKE:  Yes , there are many famous corporations .
ALEX:  When will there be a job fair ?
BLAKE:  Every Saturday and Sunday
ALEX:  Do I need to pay to go into the personnel market ?
BLAKE:  No , it's free .
ALEX:  How about going there to have a look now ?
BLAKE:  OK , let's go .
ALEX: Could you show me the T-shirt on the model ?
BLAKE:  Here you are . We have three different colors , white , blue and pink .
ALEX:  What's the price ?
BLAKE:  $ 12 .
ALEX:  Can you make it any cheaper ?
BLAKE:  It is cheap .
ALEX:  I'll take it if you give me a discount .
BLAKE:  $ 10 . That's the best I can do .
ALEX:  OK . I'll take the blue one .
ALEX: Hello , again . Did you discuss everything with your colleagues ?
BLAKE:  Yes , yes . It seems that everything is settled .
ALEX:  Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid ?
BLAKE:  We have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts , whether they are currently with this bank or not .
ALEX:  That's not a problem .
BLAKE:  Of course , if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank , or open new accounts with you .
ALEX:  Thank you very much . We always welcome new customers .
ALEX: I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking .
BLAKE:  We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments .
ALEX:  I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house .
BLAKE:  We need to find a good realtor .
ALEX:  Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .
BLAKE:  What do you mean ?
ALEX:  Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .
BLAKE:  But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .
ALEX:  Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .
BLAKE:  I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has
ALEX:  Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own.And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .
BLAKE:  So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?
ALEX:  It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .
BLAKE:  And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?
ALEX:  Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .
BLAKE:  Why ?
ALEX:  Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .
BLAKE:  Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .
ALEX:  It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .
BLAKE:  I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .
ALEX:  Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store .
ALEX: I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening.My wife is terribly ill .
BLAKE:  Sorry to hear that .
ALEX:  How about next week ?
BLAKE:  Fine , we'll be expecting you then .
ALEX: Which restaurant do you prefer ?
BLAKE:  I'd like to taste Mexican food .
ALEX:  How about the one on Baker Street ?
BLAKE:  Oh , I've never seen a better Mexican restaurant .
ALEX: The numbers in this table don't seem to be in accord with reality .
BLAKE:  I know , but these are the figures that we came up with .
ALEX: Oh , so the zoo is over there . Thank you so much for your help .
BLAKE:  You ’ re welcome . Can I ask you what brings you to China ?
ALEX:  I ’ m actually travelling around Asia .
BLAKE:  Oh , very nice . How long will you be in Beijing ?
ALEX:  Probably another week .
BLAKE:  Oh , I see . Well , I ’ ll give you my phone number and if you need a guide , please call me .
ALEX:  Thank you very much . That ’ s very kind .
ALEX: Could you type up this document for me , Sandra ?
BLAKE:  Sure , but I have to finish this report first .
ALEX:  Never mind . I'll do it .
ALEX: Are you interested in mountaineering ?
BLAKE:  Yes , in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you
ALEX:  I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . I went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains .
BLAKE:  How did you spend the night there ?
ALEX:  We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful .
BLAKE:  I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country .
ALEX:  Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't ?
BLAKE:  Yes . It is one of the Five Mountains .
ALEX:  I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ?
BLAKE:  I'd love to .
ALEX: Sir , what's wrong with you ?
BLAKE:  I have a spasm of nausea and dizziness .
ALEX:  Have you ever suffered from airsickness before ? You're probably airsick .
BLAKE:  No , this is the first time on a plane . Maybe you are right .. Please get me some pills .
ALEX:  OK . I will get some for you . There's an airsickness bag behind the seat in front of you.Please wait me for a moment . ( Go away for a few minutes , and now she comes back . ) Here are two pills . And the water is in the glass too.Please take the pills with water .
BLAKE:  Thank you very much . ( Take the pills . )
ALEX:  Are you feeling better now ?
BLAKE:  Much better now . Thanks again .
ALEX:  My pleasure .
ALEX: Hi Bill , it ’ s Jane .
BLAKE:  Jane , I ’ m on the other line , can you hang on for a second ?
ALEX:  Sure .
BLAKE:  OK , I ’ ll be right back .
ALEX: Have you decided what you'd like ?
BLAKE:  Yes . First I'll have tomato juice .
ALEX:  And then ?
BLAKE:  I'll have the lamb chops , well-done , please .
ALEX: Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ?
BLAKE:  Can you show me some traditional Chinese arts and crafts ?
ALEX:  Maybe sandalwood fan is good .
BLAKE:  Would you show me some ?
ALEX:  Of course .
BLAKE:  They really smell fragrant . How much is a real sandalwood fan ?
ALEX:  The small ones are one hundred yuan for each . And the big ones are two hundred and thirty yuan .
BLAKE:  I'll take two small ones and a big one .
ALEX:  What else are you interested in ?
BLAKE:  I'm afraid not .
ALEX:  OK . Here you are .
ALEX: Good morning.Mrs.Smith .
BLAKE:  Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother .
ALEX:  Well , what kind of books does she like ?
BLAKE:  She's very fond of detective stories ?
ALEX:  I see.Has she read any detective stories ?
BLAKE:  Oh , yes !
ALEX:  Do you know if she's read this one ?
BLAKE:  I'm not sure , but she probably won't remember if she has ! She's very forgetful !
ALEX:  Ah ! She has a bad memory.How old is she ?
BLAKE:  She's eighty-seven .
ALEX:  I suggest you take this book.It ' s very exciting .
BLAKE:  Thank you.That ' s a good idea.she likes exciting books.Can you suggest another one ?
ALEX: Hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ?
BLAKE:  Not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements .
ALEX:  Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air .
BLAKE:  I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world !
ALEX:  Really ? What's the series about ?
BLAKE:  Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it .
ALEX:  It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth .
BLAKE:  I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results .
ALEX:  Really ? that's interesting !
BLAKE:  Yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good .
ALEX:  OK , I'll give it a go .
ALEX: Hello , hot water overflowed from the bathtub . Would you help me ?
BLAKE:  Would you turn off the tap ?
ALEX:  I did it .
BLAKE:  Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door .
ALEX:  Ok , I will .
BLAKE:  I will have our housekeeper come right away .
ALEX:  I am sorry , I was too tired to fall asleep .
BLAKE:  When you woke up , the water was coming out the tub ?
ALEX:  Right . Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ?
ALEX: Hi . I'm looking for a gift for my niece .
BLAKE:  Well , little girls seem to love Barbie dolls .
ALEX:  That's perfect . I want to see one .
BLAKE:  Here you are — she's called Digital Barbie .
ALEX:  Oh , I like Digital Barbie ! How much does she cost ?
BLAKE:  This Barbie is only $ 29.95 .
ALEX:  That's perfect . Let me have her .
BLAKE:  Very good . Is there anything else you would like ?
ALEX:  No , that'll do it for now .
BLAKE:  Including tax , your total will be $ 32.42 . Cash or charge ?
ALEX:  Let me give you cash , please .
BLAKE:  Here's your change and receipt . Thank you .
ALEX: Please put your baggage on the counter and open it , let me have a look .
BLAKE:  Yes , sir . Please examine it .
ALEX:  Anything subject to duty in your suitcase ?
BLAKE:  No , sir . Nothing except my personal belongings , such as clothes , notebooks and some gifts .
ALEX:  Any cigarettes or liquor ?
BLAKE:  I have cigarettes for my own use .
ALEX:  I think you'll have to pay some duty on these cigarettes because they exceed the quota . And this article is liable for duty .
BLAKE:  How much duty should I pay ?
ALEX:  One hundred dollars .
BLAKE:  Here is the money .
ALEX:  Just a moment . I'll make out your duty memo . ( Writing and giving the memo to Mr . Green ) Take it and pay the girl over there .
BLAKE:  Thank you .
ALEX: So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ...
BLAKE:  We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ...
ALEX:  That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket .
ALEX: Excuse me , sir , may I talk to you ?
BLAKE:  Bill ! Sure , come on in . What can I do for you ?
ALEX:  Well sir , as you know , I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years .
BLAKE:  Yes .
ALEX:  I won ’ t beat around the bush . Sir , I would like a raise . I currently have three companies after me and so I decided to talk to you first .
BLAKE:  A raise ? Son , I would love to give you a raise , but this is just not the right time .
ALEX:  I understand your position , and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales , but you must also take into consideration my hard work , pro-activeness and loyalty to this company for over a decade .
BLAKE:  Taking into account these factors , and considering I don ’ t want to start a brain drain , I ’ m willing to offer you a ten percent raise and an extra five days of vacation time . How does that sound ?
ALEX:  Great ! It ’ s a deal ! Thank you , sir !
BLAKE:  Before you go , just out of curiosity , what companies were after you ?
ALEX:  Oh , the electric company , gas company and water company !
ALEX: Are you going to vote on Tuesday ?
BLAKE:  Of course . How about you ?
ALEX:  I ’ Ve already voted .
BLAKE:  How ’ s that ?
ALEX:  I sent in an absentee ballot .
BLAKE:  Why ?
ALEX:  I won ’ t be able to vote on Tuesday .
BLAKE:  Why not ?
ALEX:  I have to work .
BLAKE:  Why don ’ t you go to work late ?
ALEX:  I have important business to take care of that morning .
BLAKE:  I see .
ALEX: How would you describe your ideal job ?
BLAKE:  I think the job should make use of the professional experience I have obtained , and offer me opportunity for advancement .
ALEX:  Why do you think you might like to work for our company ?
BLAKE:  I feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and I am very interested.What ' s more , your company is outstanding in this field .
ALEX:  What makes you think you would be a success in this position ?
BLAKE:  My graduate school training combined with my experience as an intern should qualify me for this particular job . I am sure I will be successful .
ALEX:  How do you know about this company ?
BLAKE:  Your company is very reputed in this city . I heard much praise to your company .
ALEX: Did you see the picture of the guy on the front page of the newspaper this morning ?
BLAKE:  No . I haven't had a chance to read the paper yet .
ALEX:  you've got to see it . It's an unbelievable picture !
BLAKE:  What's so interesting about it ?
ALEX:  Well , this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up , half his face had been bitten off !
BLAKE:  What ? How did that happen ?
ALEX:  They think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face .
BLAKE:  Wow . What does his look like now ?
ALEX:  It looks pretty frightening . He doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . Most of his nose and chin are missing too .
BLAKE:  What did he look like before his dog bit his face off ?
ALEX:  He was actually quite handsome . What a shame .
BLAKE:  What's he going to do now ?
ALEX:  It said that he's hoping to get a face transplant , but until then , he's looking forward to Halloween so he isn't the only one wearing a mask .
ALEX: Excuse me . We're leaving today . I'd like to pay our bills now .
BLAKE:  OK . By the way , I'd like to tell you that the check-out time is 12
ALEX:  I see .
BLAKE:  Have you used any hotel services this morning or had breakfast at the hotel dining room , Mr . Green ?
ALEX:  Yes , my friend and I just had breakfast at the dining room , but we didn't use any services .
BLAKE:  How about the charge for the days you shared the room with your friend ?
ALEX:  Please add to my account .
BLAKE:  The total for the eight days is five hundred sixty yuan .

ALEX:  Where do i put the money in ?
BLAKE:  You put the coins into the slot , push it in , and it will turn on .
ALEX:  That's it ?
BLAKE:  There's nothing else to it .
ALEX:  Thank you very much .
BLAKE:  You're welcome . Let me know if you need anything else .
ALEX: Dad , can you lend me some money ?
BLAKE:  What for ?
ALEX:  I want to get a ticket for a concert tonight .
BLAKE:  All right.Here ' s the money . I suppose I'll have to drive you there .
ALEX: How much money do you expect in this position ?
BLAKE:  With my experience , I'd like to start at 3,000 RIB per month .
ALEX:  Well , it is a little more than we had planned .
BLAKE:  I think you will find I am worth it .
ALEX: Could you help me with these books ?
BLAKE:  My hands are full . Can ’ t you see that ?
ALEX:  Please , George .
BLAKE:  All right . Just wait a minute , OK ?
ALEX: I firmly believe that if we invested in funds we could earn a lot of money .
BLAKE:  All wet.You are such a fool .
ALEX: Good afternoon , sir . What can I do for you ?
BLAKE:  I'd like to get this prescription filled .

BLAKE:  I ’ m afraid I can ’ t because I ’ m a stranger here .
ALEX:  Oh , thanks all the same .
BLAKE:  Not at all . You can ask the policeman over there .
ALEX: We are interested in some precision machine tools . We have some inquires on hand .
BLAKE:  That's fine . We can supply all kinds of precision machine tools . Our products are much admired in the world market and enjoy a wide acceptance in modern industry .
ALEX:  Can I have a look at your catalogue and the corresponding technical data ?
BLAKE:  Why , of course . Here are some that will show you our latest development . You may select which ever you need .
ALEX:  I think our users have the impression that your prices are always much too high , compared with those of other supplies .
BLAKE:  Excuse me . It's true that our products do cost slightly more than the other makers , but It's only due to our technological superiority .
ALEX:  Your products may have certain advantages , but your prices are too stiff .
BLAKE:  If you give us your inquiry , I shall go very carefully into the price and try my best to put you on the best of the terms .
ALEX:  OK , I'll come back to discuss it to some details after our users have studied your catalogues and price list .
BLAKE:  Yes , surely . We hope to do some substantial business with you .
ALEX: Can I take your order now , Madam ?
BLAKE:  Yes , what would you recommend ?
ALEX:  I'm happy to recommend the fish , It testes delicious , and it is today's special . Our chef is from the coast , and love seafood . Today special is actually his favorite dish . so I'm sure it is a
BLAKE:  It does sound wonderful , maybe I'll try it .
ALEX:  Is there anything else ? Maybe I can interest you in one of fine appetizers , such as the escargot .
BLAKE:  Not today , thanks . But I'd like to know any of the vegetarian dishes .
ALEX:  Yes , here's the menu . What would you think of your order .
BLAKE:  Maybe I don't want the fish , I think I had the greenbean dish instead .
ALEX:  What kind of soup would you like ?
BLAKE:  I'd like the egg drop soup .
ALEX:  Ok , is that all ?
BLAKE:  Yes .
ALEX:  what would you like anything to drink or you wait ?
BLAKE:  Just nice water , thanks .
ALEX: Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one .
BLAKE:  Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal .
ALEX:  Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
BLAKE:  I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .

ALEX:  i hope your cat finds its way back home .
BLAKE:  i do , too .

ALEX:  Will you take long ?
BLAKE:  No ! Five minutes I promise !
ALEX:  Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish !
BLAKE:  Are you crazy ? You have no idea what you are talking about ! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . Then I need to get foundation , liq
ALEX:  Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon !
BLAKE:  What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ...
ALEX:  Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon !
ALEX: A cup of coffee sounds good , doesn't it ?

BLAKE:  Do you know what kind of vegetable you want to eat ?
ALEX:  Why don't you make some corn ?
BLAKE:  How would you like the corn ?
ALEX:  I don't understand what you mean .
BLAKE:  Do you want it boiled , grilled , or microwaved ?
ALEX:  Why don't you grill it ?
BLAKE:  That's how you want it ?
ALEX:  Yeah , that sounds delicious .
BLAKE:  Okay , I'll grill some corn then .
ALEX: How slowly you drive !
BLAKE:  I'm sorry . Something is wrong with my taxi .
ALEX:  Where does it go wrong ?
BLAKE:  Let me stop my car for check . Oh , my god . I got a flat tyre .
ALEX:  Can it keep going ?
BLAKE:  Sorry . You'd better get off for taking another taxi .
ALEX: Mom , where are you going ?
BLAKE:  I am going to buy some food to cook for supper .
ALEX:  Good . I wanna come with you .
BLAKE:  How strange ! Our little emperor now asks to help out with shopping .

ALEX:  All right . Yes , he does . The registration fee is 7 yuan , please .
ALEX: Hey there Chris , what are you up to ?
BLAKE:  I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models .
ALEX:  Oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ?
BLAKE:  Yeah , it looks that way . My wife has been bugging me about it . I thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car .
ALEX:  So this would be your first automobile ?
BLAKE:  That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike .
ALEX:  Yeah , I think I can understand your wife's position . Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order .
BLAKE:  Oh ... I don't let her ride with me . It's just too dangerous . She takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot .
ALEX:  So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting !
BLAKE:  Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility .
ALEX:  Yeah . I still remember my first car . It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 . I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car .
BLAKE:  I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us .
ALEX:  Yeah , it is a tough call . Each one has its pros and cons . Are you looking for a sedan ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I'd like a Jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives .
ALEX:  I'd advise you to listen to your wife . She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice .
ALEX: Can I help you ?
BLAKE:  I'd like to send a fax to Shenzhen .
ALEX:  Is it a photograph or a document ?
BLAKE:  Each of both .
ALEX:  Could I see both of them ?
BLAKE:  Here you are .
ALEX:  You can't send this document ; it is not clear enough to send . The photograph is all right .
BLAKE:  Well , how long will it take to arrive in Shenzhen ?
ALEX:  Couple of minutes .
BLAKE:  Great . How much ?
ALEX:  5 $ . You should change another much clearer photograph for fax .
BLAKE:  Thank you . I will deal with it .
ALEX: Good morning , can I see your passport , please ?
BLAKE:  Here you are .
ALEX:  For business or pleasure ?
BLAKE:  Business .
ALEX:  Thank you . Have a pleasant stay .
ALEX: Take care , Peter . Don't run so fast . Are you tired ?
BLAKE:  Oh , yes . May I sit on the grass ?
ALEX:  No , you mustn't sit on the grass . Don't you see the notes ?
BLAKE:  Yes , I can see it . But what's on it ?
ALEX:  It says ' Keep off the grass ! '
BLAKE:  Well , there's a bench under the tree . We can sit there .
ALEX:  Be careful . You can't smoke here .
BLAKE:  Why not ?
ALEX:  Can't you see the notes there ? It says ' No smoking here ' .
ALEX: I'd like a double room .
BLAKE:  Do you have a reservation ?
ALEX:  Yes , I called you last week from New York . My name is George Lee .
BLAKE:  Wait a second , PLS . Yes , Mr . Lee , we have a room reserved for you . How long do you plan to stay ?
ALEX:  Probably two days . My wife will join me tomorrow . Then we will decide when to leave for Seattle .
BLAKE:  Would you sign the register , PLS ?
ALEX:  By the way , does my room have a private bath ?
BLAKE:  Certainly , every room in this hotel has a private bath .
ALEX:  Does my room have twin beds or a double ? I prefer a room with twin beds .
BLAKE:  Your room has twin beds , Mr.Lee . It also has a view . I am sure you will like it . This is your key . It's on the eighth floor room 801 . The elevator's over there .
ALEX:  Thank you . One more thing , where is your restaurant ?
BLAKE:  The restaurant is on the second floor . We also have a cafeteria on the top floor . If you would like something to drink , you can either call room service or come down here . The bar is right behind the lobby .
ALEX:  Thank you , you are very kind !
BLAKE:  You are welcome !
ALEX: I need to find a bus that'll take me to the Gold Line .
BLAKE:  Where do you live ?
ALEX:  I live up in Altadena .
BLAKE:  The 264 will take you there .
ALEX:  It goes all the way there ?
BLAKE:  I know for a fact that it goes to the station .
ALEX:  What street would I catch it on ?
BLAKE:  If you go to Altadena Drive , you can catch it there .
ALEX:  I didn't know that bus went to the Gold Line station .

BLAKE:  that's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much .
