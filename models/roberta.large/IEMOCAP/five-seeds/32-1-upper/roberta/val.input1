BOB: What?
BOB: I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.
ALICE: I guess this is why I came.
BOB: Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.
BOB: I have no imagination that's all I know to tell you.
BOB: I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I
ALICE: Chris, I've been ready a long, long time.
BOB: And he's gone forever.  You're sure?
ALICE: You started to write me.
ALICE: Every day since.
ALICE: I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say.  I mean you sure can be ambiguous you know.
BOB: Give me a kiss, Ann.  Give me a-God I kissed you.
BOB: I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you.
ALICE: I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.
BOB: Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.
BOB: No, nothing like that.
BOB: Yes.  I suppose I have been but it's going from me.
BOB: I don't know where to start.
BOB: There's so many things mixed up.
BOB: You remember overseas I was in command of a company?
ALICE: Yeah, sure.
BOB: Well I lost them.
ALICE: How many?
BOB: Just about all.
BOB: It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men.
BOB: For instance, one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.
BOB: I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had.
BOB: They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.
BOB: And I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made
BOB: a sort of responsibility man for man.  You understand me?
BOB: And then I came home and it was amazing.
BOB: I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow
BOB: because nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.
BOB: I felt wrong to be alive, to open the new bank book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator.
BOB: when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that.
BOB: Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it.  I didn't want to take any of it.
BOB: I guess that included you.
BOB: Annie, Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.
ALICE: What'll I do with a fortune?
BOB: What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.
ALICE: Fine.
BOB: Is that, is that-that's just foam isn't it?  I can't even tell
BOB: Oh, no you know what I did?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid I forgot my flashlight.
BOB: The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?
ALICE: It's not yours.
BOB: Well sure.
BOB: No of course our flashlight, yours and mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight naturally.  How could we not think to bring it?
BOB: I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder do they always run during a full moon.  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?
BOB: Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.
BOB: Ah, this is great, isn't it?  I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.
ALICE: It's after eleven let's go home.
BOB: Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?
ALICE: There is no point in coming down here.
BOB: Right.
ALICE: That's my point.
BOB: That's my point too.
ALICE: So let's go home.
BOB: No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?
ALICE: Not particularly.
ALICE: I just don't.  It's stupid.
BOB: Honey this is natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year.  This is a great opportunity.
BOB: Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.
ALICE: Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die.
BOB: Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you, spawning or mating something like that.
BOB: This is the big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.
ALICE: What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.
BOB: Yeah, they do.
ALICE: Oh, Augie.
BOB: Okay but it's fish who do something none of the other fish do
BOB: like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.  There's mystery here and magic
BOB: a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you cannot be interested.
ALICE: I'm just not.
ALICE: Yes.
BOB: I don't get it.  The first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here.  You stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.
BOB: We weren't in a good spot.
ALICE: We didn't see them the first time either.
BOB: We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.
BOB: I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there. What's that.  Is that?  Is that, is that-no it's just seaweed isn't it.
BOB: Ah, man this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean think about this.  I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.
BOB: Out there someplace there's this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.
BOB: No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.
BOB: They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.
BOB: It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.
BOB: They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place
BOB: where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.
BOB: Ah, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.
ALICE: That's the wind.
ALICE: About what?
ALICE: It's ridiculous.
BOB: Well, so what do you think?
ALICE: It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.
ALICE: Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.
BOB: Well then what's bugging you?
ALICE: We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.
BOB: There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.
ALICE: For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.
BOB: Why not?
ALICE: We totally skipped. Right.
ALICE: For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions.
BOB: Why not?
ALICE: We never do.  Do we have we ever?
BOB: We've missed them twice that's not ever.
ALICE: Twice is every time we've tried that's ever.
BOB: We'll see them this year.
ALICE: and the fish won't show up.
BOB: I thought you wanted to see it.
ALICE: You don't understand anything I'm saying.
BOB: No, of course not.
ALICE: I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it never is.
BOB: It's just a fish.  Nothing to get traumatized over.
BOB: I've been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.  You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.
ALICE: We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes
ALICE: and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me
ALICE: right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them.
ALICE: And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.
BOB: Wait a minute.  I've got it.
ALICE: Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.
BOB: It was in the car right.  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?
BOB: That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time, right.  That's it.
ALICE: I would rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.
ALICE: No.
BOB: You want me to get some champagne?
ALICE: No.
ALICE: No.  No.
BOB: Well what?  Want me to breath in your ear?
ALICE: No.
BOB: Want to get married again?
ALICE: No.
BOB: What?  What do you want a divorce?
ALICE: No.
BOB: A vacation?
ALICE: No.
BOB: A new carpet, a poodle, a backrub, ice cream, a suicide pact.  What?  What?  Carla what the hell do you want?
BOB: Do you think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish.
BOB: Do you think that I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex and times I would look at you and think holy hell when's the next flight to Alaska.
BOB: No, no I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and sand in our hair and wind in our
BOB: Sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves and ha, ha baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get,
ALICE: This what, what is this?  This isn't even anything.
ALICE: Oh, right, sure this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.
BOB: I'm doing the best I can.
ALICE: I know you are, Augie.  Really I do.  I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
BOB: Maybe if you were with somebody else too.
ALICE: I didn't say that.
BOB: No, I know but still.  I know I don't make you happy.
ALICE: For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.
ALICE: Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else
ALICE: somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.
BOB: Actually now that you mention it, no I don't.
BOB: I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.
ALICE: Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water doesn't it, big old white moon.
BOB: Well look at what we got here.
ALICE: Oh, Augie you brought refreshments.
BOB: It's not champagne.
ALICE: Well then I guess we don't need glasses.
ALICE: I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this may be the spot after all.  Augie I'm sorry.
ALICE: Ahh.  It sent shivers up my spine.
BOB: What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?
ALICE: Behave exquisitely.
BOB: With the most perfect poise.
ALICE: Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy.
BOB: Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?
BOB: Don't say that, my darling.
ALICE: It's true the whole business is very poor joke.
ALICE: Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.
ALICE: Who's they?
ALICE: Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, over-bearing love of ours?
BOB: Well who knows?
ALICE: What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left still laugh?
ALICE: Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.
BOB: Do you remember that awful scene in Venice?
ALICE: Which particular one?
BOB: The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.
ALICE: Oh, Charles.  That was his name.  Charles he did wriggle so beautifully.
BOB: Horrible thing.  I hated it.
ALICE: Yes, I know you did.  You threw him out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
BOB: How long did that row last?
BOB: The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.
ALICE: It burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
ALICE: Then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.
ALICE: How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.
ALICE: And very much sillier.
BOB: As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
BOB: I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
BOB: You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
BOB: You let him kiss you.  You said you did.
ALICE: What of it?
BOB: What of it?
BOB: What about me?
BOB: That's a nice point of view, I must say.
ALICE: Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.
ALICE: No thanks.
BOB: I'll have some myself, I think.
BOB: You can hardly call three liquor glasses in the whole evening going on and on and on.
ALICE: It's become a habit with you.
ALICE: Oh, don't be so stupid.
BOB: Really, Amanda.
ALICE: What?
BOB: Nothing.
BOB: Going somewhere, my dear?
ALICE: Just making myself fascinating for you.
ALICE: The woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute will you.
ALICE: Oh, no it isn't
ALICE: It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.
BOB: Snap, snap, snap like a little adder.
ALICE: Adders don't snap they sting.
ALICE: They sting.
ALICE: I don't care, okay.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.
BOB: Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
ALICE: Yes, I did quite a lot.
ALICE: Mind your own business.
ALICE: You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.
BOB: I'm not in the least drunk.
ALICE: You always had a weak head.
BOB: I think I mentioned once before that I had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.
ALICE: On, the contrary.  A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.
ALICE: Oh, shut up.
ALICE: Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.
BOB: Very good idea.  I will.
ALICE: Why?
ALICE: There is no one upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.
BOB: There are people downstairs I suppose.
BOB: This is no time of year for Tunis.
ALICE: Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
BOB: Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
ALICE: You're far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
ALICE: Go away, go away.  I hate you.
BOB: Amanda, listen.
ALICE: Listen? Listen indeed.  I'm sick and tired of listening to you.  You damn sadistic bully.
ALICE: Stop.
BOB: Very amusing.
ALICE: Stop, stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.
BOB: You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast. And I hope I never see you again as long as I live.
ALICE: This is the end do you understand?  The end,
BOB: You're not going like this.
ALICE: finally and forever
ALICE: Oh, I am.  Let go of me.
BOB: You're not.
ALICE: Oh, I hate you. It's a good thing that I found out in time what you're really like. Marry you again?  Never, never, never.
BOB: Shut up.  Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees.
BOB: You're a mean, evil minded, little tempered witch. I hope to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live. Whore.
ALICE: I'd rather die in torment. Beast.  Brute.  Calf swine.
BOB: Yeah, hi.  Um, look, I -- all I'm trying to do right now is renew my license plate.  That's all.  I just need to get one of those little stickers.
ALICE: Okay.  What's the problem?
BOB: And I've- I've- some lady -- I got in line.  I waited for about two hours um, and, I gave her this form
BOB: that she gave to me earlier. And she said oh, I gave you the wrong one by accident.  So I was hoping I could just fill out a new one, give it to you and sort of skip this whole line business.
ALICE: Okay, um.  Do you have your photo ID with you?
BOB: Yes, I do.
ALICE: Okay.  This is the wrong form.  I'm sorry.
BOB: This is -- okay, then just can I have the form that I need.
ALICE: I don't have the form.  You're going to have to go get in that line over there and they will give you the right form.  And after you fill it out, you can bring it back to me.
BOB: Don't you -- you don't have-
BOB: are you telling me you don't have a stack of them behind the desk?
ALICE: I don't have any of
ALICE: I don't have any of them over here.  You're gonna have to go get in that line over there.  And they will give you a copy of the form.
BOB: But you're -- it's the same -- I mean, you can -- like I can't go behind your desk--
ALICE: Nope, I don't. I don't have-
BOB: or I can't go behind there- you can go behind this person's desk and just grab the form. So if you could just do that; that would help me out a lot.
ALICE: No, I can't. That's-
ALICE: I'm sorry.  You have to do things the way you have to do things here.  We have rules.
BOB: Look, can you please just-- --make this -- look, I look--
ALICE: Go get in that-- Sir-- Sir, there are people in line behind you. you need
BOB: look-- It's  been- it's been two hours.  Can you please just make this easier on me and just go and get the form?  It's not- it's really not
ALICE: I'm sorry.  I'm sorry you're having a hard time,
ALICE: but you're gonna have to go get in  that line to
BOB: What if I pay you money?
BOB: Can I pay you money?  Can I give you, like, twenty bucks and you'll go back there and get the form?
ALICE: twenty bucks? Please. Go get in that line over there.
BOB: Come on.  Will you please?  I just --I look, I  cannot-- --just if I --
ALICE: Look, I'm having a really bad day.  I'm off in twenty minutes and I just really don't need this right now, okay.
BOB: I don't care, well- You're having a bad -- I just waited in line for two hours.
ALICE: And you're gonna have to go wait again, because that's the line you need.
ALICE: I can't do that. It's against our rules. You can go get in that line over there or you can just go ahead and leave and come back another day.  Maybe there will be a shorter line.
BOB: That's all I- I just- That's all i want you to-
BOB: Rules, you just have to grab a piece of paper behind from somebody's desk
BOB: It's not rocket science.
BOB: Come -- just, please, just grab the form.  It's right over there.
ALICE: I can't do that.
BOB: Why are you being such a bitch?
ALICE: I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
BOB: Please, will you please -- will you please just grab the form?
ALICE: So go get in the other line or leave.  Or I will have you escorted out by security.
ALICE: Would you like to be kicked out of the D.M.V.?  You don't think that'll be a little embarrassing?
BOB: Fine, which line is it?
ALICE: The one you just came from.
BOB: Okay, fine.  I'll go over there.  Thanks, a lot.  You've been really helpful.
ALICE: Yeah.  Thank you.  Have a pleasant day.
BOB: It's only going to be a year.
BOB: There's nothing I --
ALICE: You're just going to pick up and leave me and our baby and miss a year of our lives?
BOB: It's -- look, it's only a year.  It'll go by quickly.  Okay.
BOB: I know, but I'll be back then.  And - and- and we'll have -- we have the rest of our lives.
BOB: I can't do that.  I have to go.
ALICE: Do you want to -- do you want to leave us behind?  I mean, I don't understand why you have to do this.
BOB: I've made a pledge.  I can't not do this at this point.
BOB: I know that. I know that. I know that.
BOB: There's nothing I can do.  I mean, I have to go.
BOB: And this is what I do.  This is -- I mean, this is my life.  And I know that you're part of my life, too, and I mean, it's only -- it's just going to be a year.  I'll be back.
ALICE: Can't you ask them?  Can't you go back and ask them if you could -- I don't know if you could change  assignments or something and you could stay here?
BOB: It's not- it's not- It's not like that.  It's not like that.  I can't do that.
ALICE: Why not?  You could, at least, try.  They have to understand
BOB: Because it's impossible.  There's -- I just can't.  I can't.
ALICE: You won't even know your child when you come back.  This -- isn't there someone you could talk to?
ALICE: Explain the situation to them and then you can stay here.
BOB: Look, honey, it's- it's- it's only going to be a year.
BOB: It's only going to be a year. I'm not going to miss my son's entire life.
ALICE: And what happens if, at the end of that year, they ask you to stay longer?  Are you just going to agree?  Are you just going to absentmindedly brainwashedly do whatever it is they tell you to do?
BOB: I'm not going to stay more than a year.  I've  agreed to a year
ALICE: Then why do you have to go a year at all?
BOB: Because I've already agreed to that.
ALICE: Well unagree.  Tell them that you can't leave right now.  I can't do this by myself.  I can't do this without you.
BOB: Yes, you can.  Yes, you can.  You know you can.  You're a strong person.
BOB: It is. It is. It is. It is. I'm going to write you every day.
BOB: What else can we do?  I -- we don't have a choice in this.  Do you understand?  You can't come with me and I can't stay here.  That's all there is to it.
ALICE: There has to be something.  I mean, we can't just live with this.  It's not -- it just won't work this way.
BOB: We don't have a choice.  I have to do this.
ALICE: Just tell them no.
BOB: I can't do it.  I'd love to.  I mean, I don't - if you understand, I don't want to stay.
BOB: I mean, I don't want to -- I don't want to leave.  I want to stay here with you.
ALICE: Then, can't you please try something?  If you go and ask them and they say no, then I would understand, but you're not even willing to ask.
ALICE: Can't you just make an effort?  Can't you just try?
BOB: I've asked already.  I can't go back.
BOB: It can't happen.  I have to go.  I want to stay really bad, but I can't.  There's just no -- I don't have an option.
ALICE: When do you leave?
BOB: Next week.
ALICE: A week.  You're giving me a week to be okay with this.
BOB: You can't make it out like I'm happy about this.  I mean, I didn't -- I didn't want to put you in this situation.
ALICE: Well it doesn't seem like you're that bothered by it.
BOB: I am.  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know what else to tell -- you know, I mean, I can tell you.  I don't know what else to do. I mean, I've been forced into this situation.
ALICE: If you really cared so much, you'd find a way out.
BOB: There's nothing I can do.  I-- I
BOB: They won't let you come along.  It's not going to happen.
ALICE: It's a free world.  I can go where I want.  Wherever you are, that's where we're going to go.
BOB: Are you kidding? Please don't be difficult about this.
BOB: [BREATHING]
ALICE: I'm finding a way to make it work.  And I will go wherever you go.  Whatever I have to do, I will make this work.
BOB: Look, I--
ALICE: You're not really giving me a lot of options.
BOB: Where I'm going is not the safest place on the earth.  Okay.
ALICE: But I'm supposed to be okay with you going there.
BOB: But I've been trained.  You have no training.
BOB: You have to.  Do you understand me?  You have to.
BOB: Well I guess we're at a stalemate then, aren't we?
BOB: Yeah, it's pretty amazing, huh?
ALICE: I can't -- how did you do it?  What happened?
ALICE: [LAUGHTER] Well you paint a romantic picture.
BOB: Well I didn't want it to be like cheesy, you know.
ALICE: Did she cry?
BOB: She didn't cry, but she was laughing a lot and it was very exciting, so...
ALICE: Oh, my God.  How long have you been planning on doing this?
BOB: Honestly, it was kind of quickly.  It was actually only in the past couple months.
ALICE: I can't believe this.  You're getting married. It's crazy!
BOB: Yeah. Yeah. So- I know.  I know. I know.  It's weird 'cause it's like the beginning of the rest of my life, you know.
ALICE: Yeah, it is.
BOB: But uh- no, I mean, you know.  You know, I really want you to like, you know, sort of
ALICE: Yeah, I would love to. Thanks. [LAUGHTER]
BOB: Okay. Well there you go.
ALICE: Oh, my God, where -- have you guys talked about where you're going to get married or--
ALICE: Oh, my God.
ALICE: Are you going to get married like on the beach barefoot or like fancier?  Like in a church.
BOB: Barefoot?
ALICE: Well I don't know.  Throwing it out there.
BOB: Yeah.  But I'm really excited.  So and everybody's going to come out and it'll be a great time.  And--
ALICE: It's so exciting.  What's the ring look like?
BOB: It's big and shiny.  I don't know.  It's silver and--
ALICE: Big and shiny.  You're such a guy. [LAUGHTER]
BOB: Yeah, I don't know. [LAUGHTER] But, yeah, so anyway -- well I wanted to tell you that, you know, 'cause you're one of my good friends and you're Kate's- one of her best friends and-
ALICE: I'm so excited for you. That's great. I'm so-
BOB: Yeah, yeah. She was actually -- she was going to tell you but I told her that I wanted to tell you and she had to work today anyway, so I decided to-
BOB: Yeah, yeah.
ALICE: It's fantastic.  I -- congratulations. It's amazing.
BOB: Thank you.  I'm really -- I'm really excited.  And it's -- I don't know, it's like a little -- it's like a little scary, 'cause I'm like, ah, you know, it's the first time I've ever done anything like this.
BOB: But, you know, it's like I really love her and I really just -- I can't imagine spending my life with anybody else but her.  So, you know, it's like I know that's the right thing.  And if you have to, you know, if you have to question that, you know, don't- don't do it.  So we're going to do it.
BOB: And it's going to -- the -- you know, I told her that I just -- I want the color brown to be as an integral in the wedding.  And, um, maybe some greens and blues.
BOB: She's okay with it.
BOB: Well, I mean I just told her--Well I just said, you know, hey, these are my suggestions.
BOB: All fruit and the color brown. Just that. That's all- that's my only request.
ALICE: This is why men don't plan weddings. [LAUGHTER]
BOB: Yeah.  Well maybe--maybe you're right. Maybe there's something to that.
ALICE: All fruit and brown. [LAUGHTER]
BOB: So, um, anyway, do you want to order now?   So, um I mean--
BOB: Oh, man, I just -- I don't know what to do.  I don't know what to do.  It's like every job, you know, I go to; every job I apply to,
BOB: it's just like nobody- nobody wants to hire me. It's been years, I mean, do you understand, years?  Like, I'm -- you know what I mean, it's like I've been collecting unemployment for so long now, it's just like I just -- I can't take it.  I don't know what to do.  I mean, I'm just like losing my mind.
ALICE: Well there has to be something you haven't tried.
BOB: I-I'm not kidding.  I've tried everything.  Like I've gone to every business and local, you know,
BOB: local business in- in the area and I can't- I can't get anything.  Like, nobody -
ALICE: What about like a temp agency?
ALICE: Have you gone, like, signed up with a temp agency?  Maybe they can help.
BOB: there's just like no jobs available.  I mean, it's just like, God.
BOB: Yeah, I tried that.  And there was like, yeah, like I did like one thing once.  But, like, that's not -- it doesn't last very long.  And it's not enough to live on.
ALICE: Right, but you have -- I mean, you have to keep on them.  You have to keep calling and reminding them that you're still looking and
ALICE: I mean, you have to be really aggressive about it.
BOB: Yeah, I do.  I do.  You don't understand.
BOB: I- You don't understand. I don't have a job.  All- My job is to look for a job.  I don't do anything else.
BOB: But, like, it's been years now and I just can't seem to get anything that really fits.  It's just it -- I -- it drives me absolutely insane.
ALICE: Well, I mean, if it's that bad, maybe you're gonna have to take something that doesn't really fit, you know.  Like maybe you'll have to do something else for a while.  Find a new field, new skill.
BOB: No, no, no, no, no.  I can't- I can't do that.  I can't, I- because if I'm not- if I'm not- if I'm not doing something that I love, then I can't -- I can't- I mean it's- what's the point?
ALICE: Well then you're choosing to be unemployed, really.
BOB: I'm not choosing. I'm not-
ALICE: If you're not willing to try and work with it and find something and, you know, I mean, there are things you could do.
BOB: No, but I'm try- but like all the things that I-it's like I apply to all these places and none of them
BOB: -- I mean, I don't understand.  It's like -- I mean, I feel like I'm qualified enough.  I just don't understand.  Like, I mean, it's just like a matter of circumstance, but it's been three years, you know, three years.
ALICE: Well maybe, you know, your luck it is just down and the market for your particular field is down and maybe you just need to look into doing something else for a while.
BOB: This is stupid.
ALICE: I mean, I'm not saying that you should, you know--
BOB: You know what, this is your fault.
BOB: It's your fault 'cause -cause you always told me to- to do this and I did that instead.  And I didn't take your advice and - and- but you sort of were like were telling--
ALICE: It's my fault 'cause you didn't do what I told you to?
BOB: Yeah, exactly.
ALICE: Well that sounds like your fault.
BOB: Yeah.
ALICE: You didn't do what I told you to do.
BOB: That's 'cause you always tell me to do the wrong thing.  And I thought this time it was -- I was gonna be right by going with the opposite thing. So it's your fault because
BOB: -because you were always wrong and-and-and this time you were right. And-and I didn't -- yeah, that's why.
BOB: Well, I mean, it makes sense, doesn't it, hmm?
ALICE: I think maybe you can't get employed because you aren't willing to take responsibility for your own actions.
BOB: That's not true.  I take responsibility for my own actions.
ALICE: Really?  Whose fault is it you don't have a job?
BOB: Yours.  I don't--
ALICE: [LAUGHTER]
BOB: Yeah, hi.  Look--Um, okay.  Here's the thing.
ALICE: Hi, how can I help you?
ALICE: Mmhmm.
BOB: lost my luggage. Your airline--
ALICE: I'm sorry.
ALICE: Right.
BOB: lost my luggage. I didn't lose it. No, it's not like I left it somewhere and somebody took it.
BOB: It was lost.  I waited on the conveyor -- near the conveyor belt to see, you know, where -- then the baggage claim and see if it would- it would come out.
BOB: Didn't come out.  I spoke to somebody, a local authority figure.
BOB: And he told me to come to this desk here so I can, uh, at least get, uh, the hundred- hundred and fifty dollars that- that I'm owed for my loss.
BOB: 'Cause that's roughly how much the bag plus all its contents was worth.
ALICE: Uh. Okay.  I -- first of all, I'm very sorry you lost your bag.
ALICE: Um, but, actually, our policy is a fifty dollar
BOB: fifty dollars?
ALICE: refund--coverage of the bag that was lost. yes
BOB: fifty dollars. No way, no.
ALICE: That's our policy, sir.
BOB: I don't but the thing is, I don't care about your policy.
BOB: You understand?
BOB: What I want you to do is I want you to write three of those, as if I were three people.  Okay.  You can write -- you can just put my name on all --
ALICE: I can't do that.
BOB: But what I'm telling you is that's what you're going to do.
BOB: No, no, because, look, I don't care what your policy says.  I mean--
ALICE: I'm very sorry.  I understand you're frustrated. You just got off of a flight.
BOB: You understand that the contents of my bag- The contents of my bag cost a hundred and fifty dollars.
BOB: You--
ALICE: We'll cover fifty.
BOB: No.  No.  No.  What I need you to do -- I need you to write checks for -- I need you to write three of them. That'll be satisfactory.
ALICE: We only cover fifty do-
BOB: Just -- you can fill out the form--We can fill out - no, no, no, we can fill out the form three times.
ALICE: We only cover fifty dollars worth of lost items.
BOB: And then that'll be that. It's going to be fine. Just-
ALICE: I'm very sorry.
ALICE: I'm very sorry.  I understand you're upset.  You just got off a long flight.
BOB: You don't understand. You don't understand, actually.  You don't understand because it was my luggage that was lost.  Okay.
ALICE: We really -- we want to work with you. We really -- we want to help.
ALICE: I understand that.  I would know if it was mine. Um-
BOB: Yeah.  If it was yours, but it's not. It's mine.  Okay. So just--
ALICE: But it's not.  It's yours.  I understand.
ALICE: I know.  We want to work with you.  We will give you the fifty dollars but I'm--
ALICE: Yeah, we don't do that.  I can go ahead and send you--
BOB: You- you- you- you're misunderstanding me.  You're going to do that.
ALICE: We will definitely keep an eye out for your bag. We will try to find it.  We will, you know, fill out the form for missing items.
BOB: Look, can I just -- can I speak to your manager, please?  'Cause I- I really -- I don't, um -- I mean, I just don't want to deal with -- I know that -- I mean, I know this isn't your fault,
ALICE: No one can make the three check thing happen 'cause we don't do that.
ALICE: I can write you the one check.
BOB: but I need to speak to somebody who can make the three check thing happen.
ALICE: All- all that my supervisor could do is the exact same thing that I'm offering to do.
BOB: But what I'm talk -- but I'm just,just- please let me--
BOB: But if I could just speak directly -- if I could just speak directly to your-- to your superior person
ALICE: I'd be happy to give you a cup of coffee, too.
ALICE: We'll just throw that in--gratuitously.
BOB: then that would be helpful to me because I just feel like if- you don't think you have the power to write three checks but you actually do. see?
ALICE: No, I don't. See, I could lose my job if I did that.
BOB: But your job is not my concern. My concern is getting my luggage.
ALICE: And your bag is not my concern.
ALICE: The fifty dollars I'm going to give you for your bag is really all I'm concerned with.
BOB: Look, I don't -- look, can we just not argue about this.  Like--
ALICE: I'm more than happy to not argue about it.  I will give you your fifty dollar certificate.
ALICE: You can go ahead and go fill out the form. We'll look for your bag.
BOB: So what if- what if we- what if we do three forms
BOB: with different names on them? That-
ALICE: Then that would be lying.
BOB: but, no. See, 'cause
BOB: if we have three forms then I can get the hundred and fifty.
ALICE: I'm sorry.  We can only issue one fifty dollar certificate to cover the lost bag for one person.
BOB: Just please, will you please just work with me here? Just -- all I'm asking you to do is just work with me. I know -- I know that you get lots of people all day long who give you shit, give you crap, but
ALICE: I understand you're frustrated, but--
BOB: um, you know, I -- this is my bag and I need the hundred and fifty dollars. Please.
ALICE: I know. I understand it's personal-- It's personal to you. I get that.
BOB: Please.
ALICE: But if you want to just sit down, you know, maybe have a cup of tea, calm down a little bit, we'll go ahead and we'll do what we can for you. you okey
BOB: I'm already calm. Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm.
BOB: Just all I need you to do is just fill out three forms and I'll leave you alone forever, forever.  I'll never -- we'll never see each other again.
ALICE: And I'm looking forward to that.  However, I can't do that. I would lose my job.
BOB: But that's not going to-- But you don't understand. You're looking forward to never seeing me again.
ALICE: Oh, yes.
BOB: But never seeing me again is not going to happen until you give me the three checks.
ALICE: I'm sorry, really.  But--
BOB: I don't -- I'm not- I'm not convinced.
ALICE: That I'm sorry?
BOB: Yeah.  If you were really sorry, you'd give me the three checks.
BOB: So why don't we just do that and stop this nonsense, hmm?  Hmm?
ALICE: Hey, how you doing?
ALICE: I'm sorry.
BOB: Thanks.
ALICE: I know- I know there's nothing I can say that will really help, but--
BOB: I know.  I just -- I don't know.  It's just weird because you have somebody who's, you know,
BOB: a major part of your life and then they're gone.  And I don't know.  That's not really -- it's never really happened to me before.
ALICE: I'm sorry.  It's never easy.
BOB: Yeah.
ALICE: But, I'm here if there's anything you need.  I mean, you just have to ask.  I know --
BOB: Thanks.
ALICE: --it doesn't really do anything.  But--
BOB: I just -- it's just not fair.
ALICE: I know.  It never is.
ALICE: How's, um -- how's his parents doing?
BOB: I mean, they're, you know, they're upset.  It's like you know, they
BOB: feel the same way everybody else does.
ALICE: I mean, what do you want to do?  Do you want to- do you want to talk about it?  Do you-
BOB: [BREATHING] I mean, there's nothing really to talk about.  He's gone and I'll never see him again.
ALICE: Well I know it's not a lot of help or anything, but at least you got to know him.  I mean, at least you had the time with him that you did.
BOB: Yeah.
ALICE: I mean, we can be grateful for that.
BOB: Yeah, I don't know.  Sometimes I wish I didn't know him.  So I wouldn't--
ALICE: You feel that way now because you're upset.  But you don't really think that.
ALICE: It'll get better.  I know it doesn't help, but it will get better and you will remember all of the good things that you guys had; all of the memories that you have with him that were happy and you'll be grateful for those.
BOB: This is just -- this is a terrible life.  I just don't understand.
BOB: I mean, it's just not fair.  Like, I don't know.  Why people -
BOB: there should just be some sort of rule that people don't die until they're older, 'cause then, at least, it's expected.
ALICE: I agree.  If I knew how to make that happen, I would certainly help you.
BOB: I don't know what to do.
ALICE: When's the service? Can- can we help?  Is there anything, I mean--
BOB: I mean, you- you can go.  I don't know.  I don't know what else.
BOB: I hope it rains.  Somehow that'll make me feel more comfortable.
ALICE: Seems like if the whole world's sad, then it's okay for you to be.
BOB: Yeah.
BOB: I just wish there was some way to just bring him back to life magically.
ALICE: I know.
BOB: Just, you know, some thing; some genie. I need to find a genie bottle.
ALICE: I don't have any magic answers.  But,
ALICE: I mean, as- as cliche as it is, as long as people who loved him remember him, then it's not a waste, you know.
BOB: I know.
BOB: Alright, so you're not going to believe this.  But I went home today. I looked through the mail.  And I got an acceptance letter from U.S.C..
BOB: I'm going to U.S.C.. Yeah.
BOB: Yeah, yeah.
ALICE: I didn't even
ALICE: know you applied to U.S.C..
BOB: I did.  I did. I've -- yeah, I applied to U.S.C..  I mean, it's really expensive but
BOB: it's a really good school.  So
ALICE: That's amazing.  I've seen it on TV. Um, Wow.  I mean, well what are you going to major in?  What are you going to do?
BOB: Yeah.  I like to know about history, 'cause, you know, it's- it's just so relevant to the present.
ALICE: Right.
BOB: Yeah.
ALICE: Yes.
BOB: And, uh-
ALICE: Is U.S.C. known for its history program?
BOB: Um, you know, I don't think so.  But I think that, you know, it's still a private school
BOB: and right you know it's still- and then, you know, I mean-
ALICE: I know.  It's a great school and you know
BOB: I'm guessing, you know it's like I I checked it out.  And, like, they have a decent history program.
ALICE: It's all about the connections
BOB: So -- and like the geology just is awesome.  It rocks, no pun intended. [LAUGHTER]
ALICE: Oh, you did not just say that.
BOB: Um, but, uh- anyway -- yeah, so that's awesome, though, because you live here and then we're not going to be separated by me going to some other school
ALICE: I know.  You're going to be so close.
BOB: And, uh, it's just really exciting.  I- You know, I'm -- just I want to- I want to share this special happy moment with you. It's awesome
ALICE: I'm glad you did.
ALICE: That's great.  I mean, I'm really glad you're not going to go anywhere.  You'll still be here.
ALICE: Everything in LA is twenty minutes away.
ALICE: Give or take. [LAUGHTER]
ALICE: Well congratulations.
BOB: umm, and I'm going to check out school and get, you know, check out the courses
BOB: find out all this stuff.  And- and I don't know.  I think I'm going to try to live in a dorm.
ALICE: Yeah.
BOB: Ouch.  That's, um -- oh, wow.
ALICE: But, congrats on the U.S.C. thing.
BOB: No, no, I mean, I didn't know -- I didn't know that about you. Um, I feel like --
ALICE: The -- what, the- I mean--
BOB: I'll go to basketball games.
ALICE: Okay.  Well that's cool, too, but like--
BOB: Maybe some golf matches.
ALICE: Wow, you are a winner and a half. [LAUGHTER]
BOB: I don't know.  Do they have golf?  Do they have- Does U.S.C. have a -- I don't know if they have a golf team.
BOB: No, I'm not going to go to a football game.
BOB: Forget it. Forget it. Forget it. No way.
BOB: I do -- I will need to get a gun-
BOB: Okay.  Um, but, no, I, uh, I do need to get a gun soon, though, 'cause I mean
ALICE: Excuse me?
BOB: I need to get like a -- just a small little gun just 'cause -- or like a taser or something or just like a butterfly knife
ALICE: No.
BOB: 'cause, you know, I mean, it's like If I ever want to go south of campus
BOB: Well I need to defend myself from
BOB: Thank you for calling Sprint.  We care about everybody.  How can I help you?
ALICE: Hi.  I've been on the phone for an hour trying to get a little discrepancy on my bill fixed.  I was charged for two hundred dollars worth of calls that I didn't make.
BOB: Are you sure you didn't make them?
ALICE: I'm positive.  They came from like another state.
BOB: Can I get your phone number, please?
ALICE: Uh. Yeah, I just gave it to the automated thing like five times.
BOB: I'm going to need it again.  I need to look at your file.  If you want me to look at your file--
ALICE: Okay.  three two three six nine seven five zero six six.  Can we move on?
BOB: Okay.
BOB: Umm, Miss Aruckman
BOB: I am seeing the two hundred dollar charge.
ALICE: Yes, and I've been through all of the menus, pushed one and star and pound and all of that stuff and I'm just trying to get through to a person who can
BOB: Well I'm looking at these.
ALICE: take off the charges that came from like Nebraska or wherever because, obviously, I didn't make those.
ALICE: So can you please refund the mischarged charges
BOB: So you're saying that you didn't make these calls.
ALICE: I did not make the calls from B.F.E. Nebraska.
BOB: Well I mean, I'm supposed to use discretion in the situation and, um--
ALICE: So could you discretion it back?
BOB: All I can do for you right now is give you a hundred dollars.
ALICE: Okay, but that's like half
BOB: What I can
ALICE: of the money that I was charged that I didn't make those calls.
BOB: What I can do for you is give you a hundred dollars right now and fill out complaint form
BOB: which you- which you'll have to go into a local Verizon dealer--  or Sprint.
ALICE: Okay, no, look, I- I- I- I'm really -- I'm trying to be patient.  I know this isn't your fault.  I know that you didn't do it
ALICE: but, at the same time, I have been through an hour of little robot voices telling me what I needed to do.
BOB: Ma'am, I understand that.
BOB: Ma'am, I - I - I understand that. I understand that. What I can do for you right now is what I'm telling you is that I can do- I can give you a hundred dollars back and then you'll have to fill out a complaint form and then you'll get -- there'll be some investigation. Some men will show up at your house and go through your things.
ALICE: Excuse me?
BOB: And then then you'll get some money back.
ALICE: How long does that take?
BOB: A few weeks.  You won't even know that they were there.
ALICE: I have to wait a few weeks for people come go through my things to get the money back that I didn't spend?
BOB: Okay.  You know what?  I just don't feel like doing this anymore.  Um, you can have all the money back, two hundred dollar, right now.
BOB: Yeah.  That's fine.  I just -- that's fine. Yeah, I mean, it doesn't make any difference to me.  I mean, it's not like it's going to cost my job or anything.
ALICE: You're just going to put it back on my account.
BOB: I mean, technically, that's policy.  But, like, I mean, I don't really care about -- nobody really cares about policy here.
BOB: Sure.
ALICE: Oh, my God, thank you so much.
BOB: You're welcome.
ALICE: I really appreciate this. I know it's not policy or whatever but, seriously
BOB: No, no, no, it's cool.  It's cool.  It's cool.  So, um
ALICE: make my life a lot easier.
BOB: You know, so- I mean, are you doing anything later?  Or um
BOB: Oh, I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  I just thought, you know, maybe you want to get some co--I mean, I'm actually -- wait, where do you live?  Oh, you're in Los Angeles, I see.  Oh, no, that sucks 'cause I'm in, actually in Alabama.
BOB: God, that's like a whole problem with like-- But, no, I mean, hey-- if you ever
BOB: if you ever come out to Montgomery, I mean, you know, just -- just call up, you know, call up the operator and I'll-- I'll be here. So, um.
ALICE: I'll
ALICE: call up the Sprint call center and, uh, you know. cool
BOB: Alright. Take Care.
ALICE: You too.
ALICE: What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.
BOB: He saw it.
BOB: He was out here when it broke.
ALICE: He's getting just like after he died.  What's the meaning in that?
BOB: I don't know the meaning of it, mom.  But I know one thing; we made a terrible mistake with dad.
ALICE: What do you mean, dishonest?
ALICE: What do you want to do?  Argue with him?
BOB: I don't want to argue with him but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore.
ALICE: You can't say that to him.
BOB: We've gotta say it to him.
ALICE: How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?
BOB: For God's sake, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.
ALICE: To you it is and to me, but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face, but there's no body and no grave, so where are you?
BOB: Alright, alright, alright.  Listen.  You know why I asked Annie here don't you?
ALICE: Why?
BOB: You know why.
BOB: Going to ask her to marry me.
ALICE: Well that's only your business, Chris.
BOB: You know it's not only my business.
ALICE: What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
ALICE: Well you want to make sure your father isn't going to have --
BOB: Well, then you know it's not only my business.
ALICE: I'm just saying.
BOB: Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.
ALICE: I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.
BOB: She's not Larry's girl.
ALICE: From father's point of view, he's not dead.  And you have no right to take his girl.
ALICE: Now you can go on from there if you know where to go. But I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.
ALICE: Now what can I do for you?
BOB: I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time after time.
BOB: To hell with that.
BOB: I wanted to get this settled first.
ALICE: How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.
ALICE: The trouble is, you don't see enough women.  You never did.
ALICE: I don't see why it has to be Annie.
BOB: Because it is.
BOB: Line?
ALICE: Alright, then, mom.
BOB: Alright, then, mom.  Did we skip something?  No.  Alright, then, mom.
ALICE: Yes we did. Do you want to keep going?
BOB: Yeah, let's keep going.
ALICE: Just give it some more thought.
BOB: I've given it three years' of thought.  I'd hope that if
BOB: father forgot about Larry, we'd have a regular wedding and everything happy.  If I can't get that here, then I'll have to get out.
ALICE: What the hell is this?
ALICE: Are you crazy?
BOB: I've been a good son too long; a good sucker.  I'm through with it.
ALICE: You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?
BOB: The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
ALICE: Must you be inspired?
BOB: Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful.
BOB: Yes, on this I would.
ALICE: You don't want to think like that.
BOB: Then you help me stay here.
ALICE: Alright.  But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for?  That's all for you, Chris.  The whole shooting match is just for you.
BOB: I know that.  Just you help me stay here.
ALICE: But don't think that way, you hear me?
BOB: No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
ALICE: Why did he invite her here?
BOB: Oh, God, line.
ALICE: Why does that bother you?
ALICE: She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why, all of a sudden--
ALICE: Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
BOB: What do you mean?  He grew up next door to the girl all his life.  Why shouldn't he want to -- why shouldn't he want to see her again?
ALICE: He's not going to marry her.
BOB: How do you know he's even thinking about it?
ALICE: It's got that about it.
BOB: Well so what?
ALICE: What's going on here, Joe?
BOB: Line.
ALICE: Now listen, kid. Now, listen.
ALICE: She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.
ALICE: Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.
ALICE: Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right.
BOB: Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?
ALICE: Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.
BOB: What do you want me to do? What do you want?
ALICE: I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.
BOB: But, Kate--
ALICE: Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.
ALICE: Laugh.  Laugh at me.  But why did that happen the very night that she came here?
ALICE: She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe--
BOB: Calm yourself.
ALICE: Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone
BOB: Calm yourself.
BOB: Alright, alright.  Calm yourself.
ALICE: You, above all, have got to believe.  You.
BOB: Why me above all?
ALICE: I can't help it.
BOB: What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?
ALICE: Every day since.
ALICE: I was waiting for you, Chris.  'Til then, you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  You sure can be ambiguous, you know.
ALICE: I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.
BOB: Yes, I suppose there has been.  But it's going from me.
BOB: I don't know where to start.
BOB: It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?
BOB: Well I lost them.
ALICE: How many?
BOB: Just about all.
ALICE: Oh, gees.
BOB: It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men.
BOB: For instance, one time it'd been raining several days.  And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket.  That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.
BOB: And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see?  But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made,
BOB: a kind of responsibility.  Man for man.  You understand me?  And then I went home and it was incredible.
BOB: There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident.  Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again.  I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow
BOB: because nobody was changed.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive;
BOB: to open that bank book; to drive the new car; to see the new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take these things out of a war, but when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.
BOB: You have to be a little better because of that.  Otherwise, we have is really loot and there's blood on it.  I don't want to take any of it.  I guess that included you.
BOB: Annie, Annie, I'm going to make you a fortune.
ALICE: What'll I do with a fortune?
BOB: Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.  How you doing?
ALICE: Fine.
BOB: Is that, is that - is that just foam?  I can't even tell.  Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them.  It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think?
BOB: How you doing?  Oh, no, you know what I did?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should have brought my flashlight.
ALICE: It's not yours.
BOB: Whose is it?
ALICE: It's ours.  It's mine, too.
BOB: Well, sure.
ALICE: You kept saying my flashlight as if it's somehow just yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?
BOB: I wonder, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?
ALICE: Yes.
BOB: Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.
BOB: You want my jacket?
ALICE: It's after eleven; let's go home.
BOB: Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?
ALICE: There is no point in coming down here.
BOB: Right.
ALICE: That's my point.
BOB: That's my point, too.
ALICE: So let's go home.
BOB: No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?
ALICE: Not particularly.
ALICE: I just don't.  It's stupid.
BOB: Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.  Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.
ALICE: Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die.
BOB: Yeah, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  I mean, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating, something like that.
BOB: There's mystery here and magic.
ALICE: What are you so excited about?
BOB: Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy.
ALICE: This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.
BOB: Yeah, they do. Okay.  But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.
BOB: There's mystery here and magic; a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you can not be interested.
ALICE: I'm just not.
ALICE: Yes.
ALICE: Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got into a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.
ALICE: We didn't see them the first time either.
BOB: no, it's just seaweed, isn't it?  Oh, man, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean, think about this.  I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.
BOB: Out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.  No one sent them an invitation or a map;
BOB: just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one, they turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.
BOB: They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.  It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.
BOB: They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask a question.  They just turn, as one, and start the swim that brings them here; to this place, where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.  Oh, man, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.
ALICE: That's the wind.
BOB: Well so what did you think?
ALICE: About what?
ALICE: Look at this, goose bumps.
BOB: Well so what'd you think?
BOB: What I said.
BOB: Certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
BOB: Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way, but are you having your period?
ALICE: Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.
BOB: Well what's bugging you?
ALICE: We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.
BOB: There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.
ALICE: We never do, do we?  Have we ever?
ALICE: Twice is every time we've tried.  That's ever.
BOB: We'll see them this year.
ALICE: You don't have any idea what I'm saying.
BOB: No, of course, not.
ALICE: I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.
BOB: It's just fish; nothing to get traumatized over.
BOB: I've been trying to work this backwards, but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.
BOB: You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see, I took a shower.  Uh, you watched the news.  You said the grunions are running tonight.  I said great, let's go.  I feel lucky tonight.
BOB: Uh,okay.  So I'm putting on my jacket; putting out the animals;
BOB: uh, taking the car out of the gara- out of the garage.
BOB: Uh.
ALICE: It was about four years ago, right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork.
BOB: Wait a minute, I've got it.
ALICE: Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.
BOB: It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course.
ALICE: I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.
ALICE: No.
ALICE: No.
BOB: What, you want me to breathe in your ear?
ALICE: No.
BOB: You want to get married again?
ALICE: No.
BOB: What, you want a divorce?
ALICE: No.
BOB: A vacation?
ALICE: No.
ALICE: I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.
BOB: Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No.
BOB: And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.
ALICE: This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
BOB: Yes, it is.
ALICE: Oh, right, sure.  This is standing on the beach.   This is waiting.  This is fighting.
BOB: Right.
ALICE: But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.
BOB: No, I know, me neither.
BOB: I'm doing the best I can.
ALICE: I know you are, Augie.  Really, I do.  I know you meant for this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and everything.  But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
ALICE: I didn't say that.
BOB: No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.
BOB: Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.
ALICE: Okay, fine.  So we're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.
BOB: I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you've got of the moon from here.
ALICE: Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.  I'm sorry, Augie.
BOB: Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.
BOB: We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we?
BOB: I don't care, then.
ALICE: Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.
BOB: What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?
ALICE: Behave exquisitely.
BOB: With the mo- with the most perfect poise?
ALICE: Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey.
ALICE: But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.
ALICE: It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.
BOB: Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?
BOB: You mustn't be serious, my dear.  That's just what they want.
ALICE: Who's they?
BOB: All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.
ALICE: If I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too.
ALICE: How long will it last, this ludicrous and overbearing love of ours?
ALICE: Shall we always want to bicker and fight?
BOB: No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.
ALICE: What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left, still laugh?
ALICE: Well that's serious enough, isn't it?
BOB: Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.
ALICE: Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I will kill you.
ALICE: Which particular one?
ALICE: Oh, Charles; that was his name, Charles.  Oh, he did wriggle so beautifully.
BOB: Horrible thing.  I hated it.
ALICE: I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
ALICE: It went on intermittently for days.
ALICE: It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom.
BOB: Line?
BOB: How -- that was a rouser wasn't it?
ALICE: That was the first time you ever hit me.
ALICE: The manager came in and found is rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear.
ALICE: How ridiculous. How utterly, utterly ridiculous.
ALICE: And very much sillier.
BOB: As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
ALICE: That was the first time you ever hit me.
BOB: I didn't hit you very hard.
ALICE: The manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear.
ALICE: How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.
ALICE: And very much sillier.
BOB: As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
BOB: I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
ALICE: Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.
BOB: You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
BOB: You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?
ALICE: Just a little, perhaps, nothing serious.
BOB: Line?
ALICE: Let him kiss you.
BOB: You let him kiss you.  You said you did.
ALICE: What of it?
BOB: What of it?
BOB: What about me?
ALICE: If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.
BOB: That's a nice point of view, I must say.
ALICE: Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.
BOB: So am I; bored stiff.
ALICE: No, thanks.
BOB: I'll have a little myself, I think.
ALICE: I don't see why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.
BOB: No particular reason.  Anyhow, they were very small ones.
ALICE: It seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.
BOB: You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.
ALICE: It's become a habit with you.
BOB: You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment.
ALICE: Oh, don't be so stupid.
BOB: Really, Amanda
ALICE: What?
BOB: Nothing.
BOB: Going out somewhere, my dear?
ALICE: No, just making myself fascinating for you
BOB: Oh.  That reply has broken my heart.
BOB: As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.
ALICE: Oh, no, it isn't.
BOB: Yes, it is.
ALICE: Oh, be quiet.
BOB: Line?
ALICE: It's a pity you didn't- It's a pity you didn't have more brandy.
BOB: It's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.
ALICE: It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.
BOB: Line?
BOB: Snap.  Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.
ALICE: Adders don't snap, they sting.
BOB: They -- nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.
ALICE: They sting.
BOB: They snap.
ALICE: I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.
ALICE: Yes, I did, quite a lot.
BOB: I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then, hmm?
ALICE: Mind your own business.
BOB: You must have had a riotous time.
BOB: No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow.
ALICE: You're quite insufferable.  I expected it's because you're drunk.
BOB: I'm not in the least drunk.
ALICE: You always had a weak head.
BOB: I think I mentioned once before that I've only had three minute liquor glasses of brandy this whole evening.  That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.
ALICE: On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.
BOB: Very interesting.  And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine?
ALICE: Oh, shut up.
ALICE: Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.
BOB: Very good idea.  I will
BOB: You better turn that off I think.
ALICE: Why?
ALICE: There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.
BOB: There are people downstairs, I suppose
ALICE: Turn it on again, please.
ALICE: Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
BOB: Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
ALICE: Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.
BOB: Turn it off.
ALICE: You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
ALICE: We swapped. Listen.
BOB: Listen--
ALICE: Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully.
BOB: You're a vile tempered, loosed living
ALICE: Stop.
BOB: wicked little beast. And I- I hope I never see you again as long as live.
ALICE: Stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear me? You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.
ALICE: This is the end.  Do you understand, the end?  Finally and forever.
BOB: You're not going like this.
ALICE: Oh, yes, I am.
BOB: No, you're not.
ALICE: Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loath you.  Thank God, I discovered in time what you're really like.
BOB: Shut up. Shut up.
BOB: You're a mean, evil minded
ALICE: Marry you again? Huh.
BOB: little vampire And I hope to God I never set eyes on you as long as I live.
ALICE: Never, never, never.  I'd rather die in torment. Beast brute.
BOB: Whore.
ALICE: Swine.
