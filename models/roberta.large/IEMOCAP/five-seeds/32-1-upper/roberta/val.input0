And your money there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air. ALICE: You should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.
BOB: It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men. BOB: For instance, one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. BOB: I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had. BOB: They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today. BOB: And I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made BOB: a sort of responsibility man for man.  You understand me? BOB: And then I came home and it was amazing. BOB: There was no meaning in it here. BOB: The whole thing to them was sort of a bus accident. Then I went to work with father and that whole rat race again. BOB: I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow BOB: because nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys. BOB: I felt wrong to be alive, to open the new bank book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator. BOB: I mean you can take those things out of war but BOB: when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that. BOB: Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it.  I didn't want to take any of it. BOB: I guess that included you. ALICE: And do you still feel that way? BOB: I want you now, Annie. ALICE: Because you mustn't feel that way anymore because you have a right to whatever you have, Chris, do you understand, everything ALICE: that includes me.  And your money there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air. ALICE: You should be proud.  A man should be paid for that. BOB: Annie, Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.

ALICE: It's not yours. BOB: Whose is it? ALICE: It's ours.  It's mine too. BOB: Well sure. ALICE: You kept saying my flashlight as if it somehow is just yours.  How's that supposed to make me feel? BOB: No of course our flashlight, yours and mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight naturally.  How could we not think to bring it? BOB: I hope the moon stays out.

We should have brought the blanket, our blanket. BOB: Ah, this is great, isn't it?  I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.

BOB: Oh, I wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around? ALICE: I'm cold. BOB: Do you want my jacket? ALICE: It's after eleven let's go home.

The first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here.  You stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car. ALICE: Last year you will also remember our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got in a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the Grunions. BOB: We weren't in a good spot. ALICE: We didn't see them the first time either. BOB: We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.
ALICE: Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die. BOB: Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you, spawning or mating something like that. BOB: This is the big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. ALICE: What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats. BOB: Yeah, they do. ALICE: Oh, Augie.

ALICE: And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be. BOB: Wait a minute.  I've got it.

ALICE: If I must laugh at everything, I must laugh at us too. BOB: Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun alright. ALICE: Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, over-bearing love of ours? BOB: Well who knows? ALICE: We always want to bicker and fight. BOB: No that fire will fade long with our passion. ALICE: Oh, dear shall we like that? BOB: It all depends on how well we've played. ALICE: What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left still laugh? BOB: Yes.  Yes.  with all his might. ALICE: Well that's serious enough, isn't it? BOB: No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors. ALICE: Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense. BOB: So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers. BOB: Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can like small quite idiotic little school children.

BOB: I don't mind what you do, see. you can paint yourself green all over BOB: and dance naked in the place Place Vendome and rush away with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best. ALICE: Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you. BOB: Do you remember that awful scene in Venice? ALICE: Which particular one? BOB: The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed. ALICE: Oh, Charles.  That was his name.  Charles he did wriggle so beautifully.

BOB: As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. ALICE: There was nothing in that, you know that. BOB: I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him. ALICE: Presents a trivial little broach. BOB: I remember it well bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste. ALICE: Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often. BOB: You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden. ALICE: I did not.  You made the whole thing up in your jealous imagination. BOB: You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he? ALICE: Just a little perhaps, nothing serious. BOB: You let him kiss you.  You said you did. ALICE: What of it? BOB: What of it? ALICE: It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me. BOB: What about me? ALICE: If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it. BOB: That's a nice point of view, I must say. ALICE: Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation. BOB: So am I.  Bored stiff.  Want some brandy? ALICE: No thanks. BOB: I'll have some myself, I think. ALICE: I don't see why you want it.  You've already had two glasses. BOB: No particular reason.

A child of two couldn't get drunk on that. ALICE: On, the contrary.  A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.

BOB: I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time after time. ALICE: You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that. BOB: To hell with that. ALICE: Did you ask Annie yet? BOB: I wanted to get this settled first. ALICE: How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does. BOB: Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  We'll find out.  Then we'll thrash it out with dad. Right, mom?  Don't avoid me. ALICE: The trouble is, you don't see enough women.  You never did. BOB: So what?  I'm not fast with women. ALICE: I don't see why it has to be Annie. BOB: Because it is. ALICE: Well that's a good answer, but it don't answer anything.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.

Annie's in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it? ALICE: You mean -- tell me something.  You mean you'd really leave the business? BOB: Yes, on this I would.

ALICE: What the hell is this? BOB: I'll get out.  I'll get married and live someplace else.  Maybe New York. ALICE: Are you crazy? BOB: I've been a good son too long; a good sucker.

Now listen, kid. ALICE: She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not. BOB: You can't read her mind. ALICE: Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited. BOB: How do you know why she waited? ALICE: Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right. BOB: Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for? ALICE: Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother. BOB: What do you want me to do? What do you want? ALICE: I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense. BOB: But, Kate-- ALICE: Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself. ALICE: Laugh.  Laugh at me.  But why did that happen the very night that she came here? ALICE: She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe--
BOB: Well, maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her. ALICE: Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see. BOB: What do you mean?  He grew up next door to the girl all his life.  Why shouldn't he want to -- why shouldn't he want to see her again? BOB: Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you. ALICE: He's not going to marry her.

ALICE: I'm cold.

BOB: Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.  How you doing? ALICE: Fine. BOB: Is that, is that - is that just foam?  I can't even tell.  Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them.  It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think? BOB: How you doing?

ALICE: It's after eleven; let's go home. BOB: Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home? ALICE: There is no point in coming down here. BOB: Right. ALICE: That's my point. BOB: That's my point, too. ALICE: So let's go home. BOB: No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it? ALICE: Not particularly. BOB: Why not? ALICE: I just don't.  It's stupid. BOB: Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.  Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up. ALICE: Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die. BOB: Yeah, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  I mean, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating, something like that. BOB: There's mystery here and magic. ALICE: What are you so excited about? BOB: Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy.

But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.

It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.  No one sent them an invitation or a map;

They're all told the same story.  It's what keeps us coming back for more; keeps us excited; keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we could just find the right spot; get in on the action.

ALICE: Look at this, goose bumps. BOB: Well so what'd you think? ALICE: About what? BOB: What I said. ALICE: It's ridiculous. BOB: Certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact. ALICE: It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach. BOB: I'm not the only one.  Look at these people. ALICE: Sure.  They're all told the same story.  It's what keeps us coming back for more; keeps us excited; keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we could just find the right spot; get in on the action.

ALICE: Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey. BOB: Ah.  Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter when one's happy, do they? ALICE: But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy. BOB: Don't say that, darling. ALICE: It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke. BOB: Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love? ALICE: Yes, meaning just that. BOB: What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean? ALICE: Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious. BOB: You mustn't be serious, my dear.  That's just what they want. ALICE: Who's they? BOB: All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.
BOB: Good God. ALICE: Do you think it's them? BOB: I wonder. ALICE: Nobody knows we're here, except Freda and she wouldn't ring up. BOB: It must be them, then. ALICE: What are we to do?

BOB: So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and- and enjoy the party as much as we can, like very small, quite idiotic little school children.

ALICE: Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I will kill you. BOB: Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice? ALICE: Which particular one? BOB: The one when you bought that little painted wooded snake and put it on my bed? ALICE: Oh, Charles; that was his name, Charles.  Oh, he did wriggle so beautifully. BOB: Horrible thing.  I hated it. ALICE: I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that. BOB: How long did that row last? ALICE: It went on intermittently for days. BOB: The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown. ALICE: It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom. BOB: Line? BOB: How -- that was a rouser wasn't it? ALICE: That was the first time you ever hit me. BOB: I didn't hit you very hard.
ALICE: Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense. BOB: So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and- and enjoy the party as much as we can, like very small, quite idiotic little school children. BOB: Let's savor the delight of the moment.

ALICE: No, just making myself fascinating for you BOB: Oh.  That reply has broken my heart. ALICE: The woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you?

BOB: It's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable. ALICE: It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you. BOB: Line?

Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder. ALICE: Adders don't snap, they sting. BOB: They -- nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. ALICE: They sting.

ALICE: Yes, I did, quite a lot. BOB: I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then, hmm? ALICE: Mind your own business. BOB: You must have had a riotous time. BOB: No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow. ALICE: You're quite insufferable.  I expected it's because you're drunk. BOB: I'm not in the least drunk. ALICE: You always had a weak head. BOB: I think I mentioned once before that I've only had three minute liquor glasses of brandy this whole evening.  That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk. ALICE: On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy. BOB: Very interesting.  And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine? ALICE: Oh, shut up. BOB: We might get up a splendid little- a splendid little debate about this, you know, intemperate tots. ALICE: Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.
