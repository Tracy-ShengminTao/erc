You know overseas I was in command of a company?
ALICE: Then what?  Chris.  Even in your letters, there was something ashamed. BOB: Yeah.  I suppose I have been. But it's going from me. ALICE: You've got to tell me.

ALICE: Yeah, sure. BOB: Well I lost them. ALICE: How many? BOB: Pretty much all. ALICE: Aw, geez. BOB: You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know? BOB: Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had.

Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today. BOB: And I had this idea as I was watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, you know, but this one thing was being made.  It was kind of a monument, it's kind of responsibility, man for man.

BOB: To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them. BOB: But then I came home and it was incredible, you know?  The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident.  You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work. BOB: Driving my new car and seeing a new refrigerator. BOB: I mean...You can't take those things out of a war. when you drive that car and you see that new refrigerator, you have to know that it came out of the love that a man can have for another man.

Everything you have, you've earned - everything.  you understand me? ALICE: Even me.  And your money?  Chris, there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes into the air, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that. BOB: Annie, Annie.  I am going to make a fortune for you.
BOB: What time is it?  I think it's supposed to run around midnight, right?  God, this is great, isn't it, Carla?  Look at this night we got here, huh. BOB: Actually I want to get a little further up the coast, get away from all like the lights and the people, but...  How are you doing?

BOB: You know, flippancy brings out the acid in their darned, light and sweetness. ALICE: you know if I laugh at everything then I must laugh at us, too. BOB: Oh of course.  We are figures of fun.  All right. ALICE: How long with it last, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours?
ALICE: How long with it last, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours? BOB: Who knows? ALICE: Shall we always want to bicker and fight? BOB: Oh no.  That fire will fade along with our passion. ALICE: Oh dear, should we like that? BOB: Well it depends on how well we've played. ALICE: What happens if one of us dies?  Does the other one still laugh?
BOB: Well it depends on how well we've played. ALICE: What happens if one of us dies?  Does the other one still laugh? BOB: Yes.  Yes with all of his might.

Thank you, darling.  The same applies to you too, except that if you so much as look at another woman I'll kill you. BOB: Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice? ALICE: Which particular one? BOB: The one where you put that tiny painted wooden snake in my bed.
BOB: It was a terrible thing.  I hated it. ALICE: I know you did.  You threw him out the window into the Grand Canal.  I'll never forgive you for that. BOB: How long did that row last?

BOB: Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can.  Like quite idiotic, very small school children.  Let's savor the delight of the moment. BOB: Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets. ALICE: Elliott, worms don't pop. BOB: I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as you love me best.

ALICE: No, it wasn't.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often. BOB: You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden. ALICE: No, I didn't.

ALICE: Yeah, sure. BOB: Well, I lost them. ALICE: How many? BOB: Just about all. ALICE: Geez. BOB: It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men.

This is, this is a great opportunity. Think about the people in Kansas. They would have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservation to come and see this. We're only forty minutes away. This is too good to pass up.

This is too good to pass up. ALICE: Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die. BOB: Yeah. But that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. And all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you-spawning or mating or something like that.

BOB: What, okay, then it's fish that do something no other fish do. Like the swallows in Capistrano or the lemmings who throw themselves off the cliffs. BOB: There's magic here and mystery and a little bit of the unexplainable. I mean, I don't see how you cannot be interested. ALICE: I'm just not. I mean, I'm sorry, it just-they're still fish to me. BOB: For real? ALICE: Yes. BOB: I don't get it. The last time-the first time that we came to see it you said it was the best night of your life. BOB: And then last year when we came to see it you ran out of the house so fast that you stubbed your toe. And you didn't even notice until you got in the car.
ALICE: I'm just not. I mean, I'm sorry, it just-they're still fish to me. BOB: For real? ALICE: Yes. BOB: I don't get it.

BOB: Jesus, welcome to the human race. BOB: Did you think this is how I thought it was going to turn out? Do you think I had some great fantasy down the line? That four years down the line that we'd come to the beach and argue with each other over fish? BOB: No, I was just like you. I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great. And the wind in our hair and the sand in our toes, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves, and we'll have three big fat rosy kids. And oh God.

ALICE: [LAUGHTER] God, it sent shivers up my spine. BOB: things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they? ALICE: Um terrible thing is one can't stay happy. Well, it's true. I mean, the whole business is a very poor joke. BOB: Ooh darling, don't say that. BOB: You mean that sacred and beautiful thing, love? ALICE: Yes, meaning just that.

ALICE: Well, that's serious enough. BOB: No. No, it isn't. Death's very laughable. A cunning little mystery. All done with mirrors. ALICE: Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.

BOB: Let's blow strumpets, blow-blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like small quite idiotic school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment. Come, kiss me darling, before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets. ALICE: Elliott, worms don't pop. BOB: I don't care what you do, see? As long-you can paint yourself bright green all over and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.

ALICE: Which particular one? BOB: The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it in my bed.
ALICE: Oh Charles. That was his name. Charles. He did wiggle so beautifully. BOB: Horrible little thing. I hated it. ALICE: I know you did. You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal. I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that. BOB: How long did that row last? ALICE: It went on intermittently for days. BOB: The worst one was in Cannes when your-your curling iron burnt a hole in my dressing gown. ALICE: Well, I burnt a hole in my comb too, and all the towels in the bathroom. [LAUGHTER].

BOB: As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. ALICE: You knew there was nothing in that. BOB: I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him. ALICE: Presents? It was only a small trivial little broach.
BOB: I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him. ALICE: Presents? It was only a small trivial little broach. BOB: I remember it well. Bristling with diamonds. In the worst possible taste. ALICE: Not at all. It was very pretty. And I wear it all the time. I still have it. BOB: You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden. ALICE: No, I didn't. You made that up all in your jealous imagination. BOB: You must admit that he was in love with you.
