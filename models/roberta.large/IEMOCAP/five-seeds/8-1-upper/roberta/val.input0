All that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you, spawning or mating something like that. BOB: This is the big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. ALICE: What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats. BOB: Yeah, they do.

ALICE: You started to write me. BOB: You felt something that far back? ALICE: Every day since. BOB: Anne, why didn't you let me know? ALICE: I was waiting for you, Chris.  'Til then, you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  You sure can be ambiguous, you know. BOB: Anne, give me a kiss.  Give me a - BOB: I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've waited to kiss you.

BOB: Well I lost them. ALICE: How many? BOB: Just about all. ALICE: Oh, gees. BOB: It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men. BOB: For instance, one time it'd been raining several days.  And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket.  That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. BOB: They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.

BOB: You have to be a little better because of that.  Otherwise, we have is really loot and there's blood on it.  I don't want to take any of it.  I guess that included you. ALICE: And do you still feel that way? BOB: I want you now, Annie. ALICE: Because you mustn't feel that way anymore, Chris.  Because you have a right to everything you have, everything, Chris; to me, too. ALICE: And your money, there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  You should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.

BOB: What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here; couldn't be better. BOB: Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.  How you doing?

BOB: There's mystery here and magic; a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you can not be interested. ALICE: I'm just not. BOB: For real?
ALICE: This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats. BOB: Yeah, they do. Okay.  But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that. BOB: There's mystery here and magic; a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you can not be interested. ALICE: I'm just not. BOB: For real? ALICE: Yes. BOB: I don't get it.  First time we came here to see it, you said it was the best night of your life.  And last year, I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here, you stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.

BOB: We weren't in a good spot.

ALICE: Look at this, goose bumps. BOB: Well so what'd you think? ALICE: About what? BOB: What I said. ALICE: It's ridiculous.
ALICE: It's ridiculous. BOB: Certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact. ALICE: It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach. BOB: I'm not the only one.  Look at these people. ALICE: Sure.  They're all told the same story.  It's what keeps us coming back for more; keeps us excited; keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we could just find the right spot; get in on the action.

You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No. BOB: No, I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and wind in our hair and sand in our toes and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves.

BOB: Good God. ALICE: Do you think it's them? BOB: I wonder. ALICE: Nobody knows we're here, except Freda and she wouldn't ring up. BOB: It must be them, then. ALICE: What are we to do?
ALICE: Do you think it's them? BOB: I wonder. ALICE: Nobody knows we're here, except Freda and she wouldn't ring up. BOB: It must be them, then. ALICE: What are we to do? BOB: We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we? ALICE: Now and always sweet.
BOB: It must be them, then. ALICE: What are we to do? BOB: We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we? ALICE: Now and always sweet. BOB: I don't care, then. ALICE: It was bound to come sooner or later. BOB: Hello, hello.  What?  Wrong number.

BOB: With the mo- with the most perfect poise? ALICE: Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey. BOB: Ah.  Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter when one's happy, do they?
BOB: What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us? ALICE: Behave exquisitely. BOB: With the mo- with the most perfect poise? ALICE: Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey. BOB: Ah.

ALICE: But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy. BOB: Don't say that, darling. ALICE: It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke. BOB: Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love? ALICE: Yes, meaning just that. BOB: What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean? ALICE: Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.

Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.

ALICE: Well that's serious enough, isn't it? BOB: No, no, it isn't.  Death's very laughable; such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors. ALICE: Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense. BOB: So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and- and enjoy the party as much as we can, like very small, quite idiotic little school children.

You can paint yourself bright green all over and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.
