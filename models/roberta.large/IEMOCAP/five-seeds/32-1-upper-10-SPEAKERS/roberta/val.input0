MICHAEL: Just about all. LINDA: Oh, gees. MICHAEL: It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men. MICHAEL: For instance, one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. MICHAEL: I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had. MICHAEL: They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today. MICHAEL: And I got this idea watching them go down.

LINDA: And do you still feel that way? MICHAEL: I want you now, Annie. LINDA: Because you mustn't feel that way anymore because you have a right to whatever you have, Chris, do you understand, everything LINDA: that includes me.  And your money there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air. LINDA: You should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.

LINDA: Not particularly. MICHAEL: Why not? LINDA: I just don't.  It's stupid. MICHAEL: Honey this is natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year.  This is a great opportunity. MICHAEL: Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up. LINDA: Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die. MICHAEL: Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you, spawning or mating something like that. MICHAEL: This is the big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. LINDA: What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats. MICHAEL: Yeah, they do. LINDA: Oh, Augie. MICHAEL: Okay but it's fish who do something none of the other fish do MICHAEL: like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.  There's mystery here and magic MICHAEL: a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you cannot be interested. LINDA: I'm just not. MICHAEL: For real? LINDA: Yes. MICHAEL: I don't get it.  The first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here.  You stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car. LINDA: Last year you will also remember our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.

MICHAEL: Why not? LINDA: We never do.  Do we have we ever? MICHAEL: We've missed them twice that's not ever. LINDA: Twice is every time we've tried that's ever. MICHAEL: We'll see them this year. LINDA: No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Clause. LINDA: God I feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up, LINDA: and the fish won't show up. MICHAEL: I thought you wanted to see it. LINDA: You don't understand anything I'm saying. MICHAEL: No, of course not. LINDA: I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it never is. MICHAEL: It's just a fish.  Nothing to get traumatized over. LINDA: For heaven's sake, this is not about fish. MICHAEL: I've been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.  You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem. MICHAEL: Let's see I took a shower.  You watched the news.  You said the Grunions are running tonight. I said great let's go.  I feel lucky tonight. MICHAEL: Okay.  Uh, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals.  We're getting the car out of the garage. LINDA: Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married. LINDA: We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes LINDA: and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me LINDA: right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them.
MICHAEL: We've missed them twice that's not ever. LINDA: Twice is every time we've tried that's ever. MICHAEL: We'll see them this year. LINDA: No, we won't.  It's pointless.

LINDA: And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.
LINDA: Twice is every time we've tried that's ever. MICHAEL: We'll see them this year. LINDA: No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Clause.

MICHAEL: Do you think that I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex and times I would look at you and think holy hell when's the next flight to Alaska. MICHAEL: No, no I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and sand in our hair and wind in our MICHAEL: Sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves and ha, ha baby the jokes on us.

LINDA: For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you. MICHAEL: Yeah? LINDA: Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else LINDA: somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.

LINDA: Well that's serious enough, isn't it? MICHAEL: No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors.

MICHAEL: Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can like small quite idiotic little school children. MICHAEL: Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets. LINDA: Elliott, worms don't pop. MICHAEL: I don't mind what you do, see. you can paint yourself green all over MICHAEL: and dance naked in the place Place Vendome and rush away with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best. LINDA: Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.
LINDA: Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious. MICHAEL: You mustn't be serious, my darling.  It's just what they want. LINDA: Who's they? MICHAEL: All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.

MICHAEL: As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. LINDA: There was nothing in that, you know that. MICHAEL: I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him. LINDA: Presents a trivial little broach. MICHAEL: I remember it well bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste. LINDA: Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often. MICHAEL: You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden. LINDA: I did not.  You made the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.

MICHAEL: What of it? LINDA: It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me. MICHAEL: What about me? LINDA: If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it. MICHAEL: That's a nice point of view, I must say. LINDA: Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation. MICHAEL: So am I.  Bored stiff.  Want some brandy? LINDA: No thanks.

MICHAEL: Very interesting and how about a child of six and a child of four and a child of nine. LINDA: Oh, shut up. MICHAEL: They'd get up a splendid little debate about that, you know.  Intemperate tots. LINDA: Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy. MICHAEL: Very good idea.  I will. MICHAEL: You'd better turn that off I think. LINDA: Why? MICHAEL: It's very late and it will annoy the people upstairs. LINDA: There is no one upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio. MICHAEL: There are people downstairs I suppose. LINDA: They're away in Tunis. MICHAEL: This is no time of year for Tunis. LINDA: Turn it on again, please. MICHAEL: I'll do no such thing. LINDA: Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic. MICHAEL: Turn it off.  It's driving me mad. LINDA: You're far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself. MICHAEL: Turn it off. LINDA: Go away, go away.  I hate you. MICHAEL: Amanda, listen. LINDA: Listen? Listen indeed.  I'm sick and tired of listening to you.  You damn sadistic bully.
LINDA: Yes, I did quite a lot. MICHAEL: I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then. LINDA: Mind your own business. MICHAEL: You must have had a riotous time.  No restraint at all, very enjoyable, you never had much anyhow. LINDA: You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk. MICHAEL: I'm not in the least drunk.

That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off. LINDA: What do you mean, dishonest? MICHAEL: You know that Larry's not coming back.  And I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him? LINDA: What do you want to do?  Argue with him?

MICHAEL: Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years, now.

LINDA: What do you want to do?  Argue with him? MICHAEL: I don't want to argue with him but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore. MICHAEL: Why shouldn't he dream of him?  Walk the nights waiting for him. MICHAEL: Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years, now. LINDA: You can't say that to him. MICHAEL: We've gotta say it to him. LINDA: How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it? MICHAEL: For God's sake, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.

He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know?  Because I don't. MICHAEL: Line? LINDA: Alright, then, mom. MICHAEL: Alright, then, mom.  Did we skip something?  No.  Alright, then, mom.
LINDA: I'm just saying. MICHAEL: Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things. LINDA: I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl. MICHAEL: She's not Larry's girl. LINDA: From father's point of view, he's not dead.  And you have no right to take his girl. LINDA: Now you can go on from there if you know where to go. But I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know. LINDA: Now what can I do for you? MICHAEL: I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time after time. LINDA: You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that. MICHAEL: To hell with that. LINDA: Did you ask Annie yet? MICHAEL: I wanted to get this settled first. LINDA: How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does. MICHAEL: Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  We'll find out.  Then we'll thrash it out with dad. Right, mom?  Don't avoid me. LINDA: The trouble is, you don't see enough women.  You never did.

MICHAEL: Because it is. LINDA: Well that's a good answer, but it don't answer anything.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know?  Because I don't. MICHAEL: Line? LINDA: Alright, then, mom. MICHAEL: Alright, then, mom.  Did we skip something?  No.  Alright, then, mom. LINDA: Yes we did. Do you want to keep going? MICHAEL: Yeah, let's keep going. LINDA: Just give it some more thought. MICHAEL: I've given it three years' of thought.  I'd hope that if MICHAEL: father forgot about Larry, we'd have a regular wedding and everything happy.  If I can't get that here, then I'll have to get out. LINDA: What the hell is this? MICHAEL: I'll get out.  I'll get married and live someplace else.  Maybe New York. LINDA: Are you crazy? MICHAEL: I've been a good son too long; a good sucker.  I'm through with it. LINDA: You've got a business here.  What the hell is this? MICHAEL: The business?  The business doesn't inspire me. LINDA: Must you be inspired? MICHAEL: Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful. MICHAEL: I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it? LINDA: You mean -- tell me something.  You mean you'd really leave the business? MICHAEL: Yes, on this I would. LINDA: You don't want to think like that. MICHAEL: Then you help me stay here. LINDA: Alright.  But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for?  That's all for you, Chris.  The whole shooting match is just for you. MICHAEL: I know that.  Just you help me stay here.

LINDA: Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see. MICHAEL: What do you mean?  He grew up next door to the girl all his life.  Why shouldn't he want to -- why shouldn't he want to see her again? MICHAEL: Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you. LINDA: He's not going to marry her. MICHAEL: How do you know he's even thinking about it? LINDA: It's got that about it. MICHAEL: Well so what? LINDA: What's going on here, Joe? MICHAEL: Line. LINDA: Now listen, kid. Now, listen. MICHAEL: Oh.  Now listen, kid. LINDA: She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not. MICHAEL: You can't read her mind. LINDA: Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited. MICHAEL: How do you know why she waited? LINDA: Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right. MICHAEL: Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for? LINDA: Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother. MICHAEL: What do you want me to do? What do you want? LINDA: I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense. MICHAEL: But, Kate-- LINDA: Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself. LINDA: Laugh.  Laugh at me.  But why did that happen the very night that she came here? LINDA: She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe-- MICHAEL: Calm yourself. LINDA: Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone

LINDA: You're the only one I know who loves his parents. MICHAEL: I know.  It went out of style, didn't it? LINDA: It's okay.  It's a good thing.  You know, it's lovely here and the air is sweet. MICHAEL: So you're not sorry you came? LINDA: No, not sorry, but I'm not going to stay. MICHAEL: Why? LINDA: In the first place, your mother as much as told me to go. LINDA: You saw that and then you've been kind of-- MICHAEL: What? LINDA: Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.

But it's going from me. LINDA: You've got to tell me. MICHAEL: I don't know where to start. LINDA: It wouldn't work this way. MICHAEL: It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company? LINDA: Yeah, sure. MICHAEL: Well I lost them. LINDA: How many? MICHAEL: Just about all. LINDA: Oh, gees.

Me flashlight es su flashlight, naturally.  How could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out. MICHAEL: I wonder, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember? LINDA: Yes. MICHAEL: Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket. MICHAEL: Oh, man.  This is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Six pack would be just the ticket right about now.  I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.  Oh.

MICHAEL: Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.  How you doing? LINDA: Fine.

Oh, no, you know what I did?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should have brought my flashlight. LINDA: What flashlight? MICHAEL: The flashlight; the silver one.

MICHAEL: Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home? LINDA: There is no point in coming down here. MICHAEL: Right. LINDA: That's my point. MICHAEL: That's my point, too. LINDA: So let's go home. MICHAEL: No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it? LINDA: Not particularly. MICHAEL: Why not? LINDA: I just don't.  It's stupid. MICHAEL: Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.  Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up. LINDA: Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die. MICHAEL: Yeah, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  I mean, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating, something like that. MICHAEL: There's mystery here and magic. LINDA: What are you so excited about? MICHAEL: Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy. LINDA: This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.

But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.

First time we came here to see it, you said it was the best night of your life.  And last year, I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here, you stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.

LINDA: Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got into a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions. MICHAEL: We weren't in a good spot.

I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.

It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.  No one sent them an invitation or a map;

MICHAEL: They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.  It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.

They don't give it a name or ask a question.  They just turn, as one, and start the swim that brings them here; to this place, where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.  Oh, man, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.

LINDA: Look at this, goose bumps. MICHAEL: Well so what'd you think? LINDA: About what? MICHAEL: What I said. LINDA: It's ridiculous.
LINDA: Look at this, goose bumps. MICHAEL: Well so what'd you think? LINDA: About what? MICHAEL: What I said. LINDA: It's ridiculous. MICHAEL: Certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact. LINDA: It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach. MICHAEL: I'm not the only one.  Look at these people. LINDA: Sure.  They're all told the same story.  It's what keeps us coming back for more; keeps us excited; keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we could just find the right spot; get in on the action.

LINDA: Look at this, goose bumps. MICHAEL: Well so what'd you think? LINDA: About what? MICHAEL: What I said. LINDA: It's ridiculous. MICHAEL: Certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact. LINDA: It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach. MICHAEL: I'm not the only one.  Look at these people. LINDA: Sure.  They're all told the same story.  It's what keeps us coming back for more; keeps us excited; keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we could just find the right spot; get in on the action. MICHAEL: Are we talking about the same thing? LINDA: Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me. MICHAEL: Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way, but are you having your period? LINDA: Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting. MICHAEL: Well what's bugging you? LINDA: We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like. MICHAEL: There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home. LINDA: For heaven's sake, we are not going to see the grunions. MICHAEL: Why not?

LINDA: No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus.  I feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up. MICHAEL: I thought you wanted to see them.

So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork. LINDA: And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me, right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.

Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course.

MICHAEL: You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see, I took a shower.  Uh, you watched the news.

So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork. LINDA: And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me, right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be. MICHAEL: Wait a minute, I've got it. LINDA: Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle. MICHAEL: It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course. LINDA: I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things. MICHAEL: Sure.  Okay.  Alright.  I've got it.  Listen do you want to dance?

MICHAEL: And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This. LINDA: This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything. MICHAEL: Yes, it is. LINDA: Oh, right, sure.  This is standing on the beach.   This is waiting.  This is fighting.
MICHAEL: It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course. LINDA: I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things. MICHAEL: Sure.  Okay.  Alright.  I've got it.

LINDA: No. MICHAEL: What, you want a divorce? LINDA: No. MICHAEL: A vacation? LINDA: No. MICHAEL: A new carpet?  A poodle?  An ice cream?  A back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What, Carla?  What the hell do you want? LINDA: I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to. MICHAEL: Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No. MICHAEL: No, I'm just like you.

Dear God, what does it all mean? LINDA: Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious. MICHAEL: You mustn't be serious, my dear.  That's just what they want. LINDA: Who's they?
MICHAEL: Good God. LINDA: Do you think it's them? MICHAEL: I wonder. LINDA: Nobody knows we're here, except Freda and she wouldn't ring up. MICHAEL: It must be them, then. LINDA: What are we to do? MICHAEL: We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we? LINDA: Now and always sweet. MICHAEL: I don't care, then. LINDA: It was bound to come sooner or later. MICHAEL: Hello, hello.  What?  Wrong number. LINDA: Oh, it sent shivers up my spine. MICHAEL: What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us? LINDA: Behave exquisitely. MICHAEL: With the mo- with the most perfect poise? LINDA: Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey. MICHAEL: Ah.  Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter when one's happy, do they? LINDA: But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy. MICHAEL: Don't say that, darling. LINDA: It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.

MICHAEL: All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.

Death's very laughable; such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors. LINDA: Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense. MICHAEL: So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and- and enjoy the party as much as we can, like very small, quite idiotic little school children.

Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets. LINDA: Elliot, worms don't pop. MICHAEL: I don't mind what you do, see?  You can paint yourself bright green all over and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.

LINDA: Which particular one? MICHAEL: The one when you bought that little painted wooded snake and put it on my bed? LINDA: Oh, Charles; that was his name, Charles.  Oh, he did wriggle so beautifully. MICHAEL: Horrible thing.  I hated it. LINDA: I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that. MICHAEL: How long did that row last? LINDA: It went on intermittently for days. MICHAEL: The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown. LINDA: It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom. MICHAEL: Line? MICHAEL: How -- that was a rouser wasn't it?
LINDA: Well that's serious enough, isn't it? MICHAEL: No, no, it isn't.  Death's very laughable; such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors. LINDA: Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense. MICHAEL: So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and- and enjoy the party as much as we can, like very small, quite idiotic little school children. MICHAEL: Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets. LINDA: Elliot, worms don't pop. MICHAEL: I don't mind what you do, see?

MICHAEL: I didn't hit you very hard. LINDA: The manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear. MICHAEL: I shall never forget his face. LINDA: How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous. MICHAEL: We were very much younger then. LINDA: And very much sillier. MICHAEL: As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. LINDA: You knew there was nothing in that. MICHAEL: I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him. LINDA: Presents?  A trivial little brooch. MICHAEL: I remember it well, bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste. LINDA: Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often. MICHAEL: You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden. LINDA: I did not.  You made the whole thing up in your jealous imagination. MICHAEL: You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he? LINDA: Just a little, perhaps, nothing serious. MICHAEL: Line? LINDA: Let him kiss you. MICHAEL: You let him kiss you.  You said you did. LINDA: What of it? MICHAEL: What of it? LINDA: It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me. MICHAEL: What about me? LINDA: If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it. MICHAEL: That's a nice point of view, I must say. LINDA: Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation. MICHAEL: So am I; bored stiff. MICHAEL: You want some brandy? LINDA: No, thanks. MICHAEL: I'll have a little myself, I think. LINDA: I don't see why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.

LINDA: It seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing. MICHAEL: You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on. LINDA: It's become a habit with you. MICHAEL: You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment. LINDA: Oh, don't be so stupid. MICHAEL: Really, Amanda LINDA: What? MICHAEL: Nothing. MICHAEL: Going out somewhere, my dear? LINDA: No, just making myself fascinating for you MICHAEL: Oh.  That reply has broken my heart. LINDA: The woman's job is to allure the man.
