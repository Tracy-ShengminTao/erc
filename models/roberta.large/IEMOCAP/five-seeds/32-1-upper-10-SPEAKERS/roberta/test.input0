I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that! WILLIAM: And if you're not, then it's all just loot and it's got blood on it, and I don't want any of it!  And, I guess that included you. ELIZABETH: Do you still feel like that? WILLIAM: I I want you now, Annie. ELIZABETH: Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that. WILLIAM: Oh Annie.  Annie, I am going to make you a fortune!

WILLIAM: I thought you wanted to see it. ELIZABETH: I did, I do want to see it.  I always want to see it, Augie. WILLIAM: It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatize over. ELIZABETH: For heaven's sake, this is not about fish. WILLIAM: Okay, I been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint a moment when we took a turn for the worst here. WILLIAM: When you are on the phone with Marge, everything was fine.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.

ELIZABETH: We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them. ELIZABETH: And I remember thinking, Finally, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be. WILLIAM: Wait a minute, I got it. ELIZABETH: Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle. WILLIAM: It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's get some champagne.  And I said time wasting or something like that.  Right? of course.

WILLIAM: Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off. ELIZABETH: What do you mean dishonest? WILLIAM: You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him? ELIZABETH: What do you want to do, argue with him? WILLIAM: I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore. WILLIAM: Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now? ELIZABETH: You can't say that to him. WILLIAM: We have to say it to him. ELIZABETH: how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it? WILLIAM: For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane!

All right, mom.  Just listen.  You know why I invited Annie her, don't you? ELIZABETH: Why? WILLIAM: You know. ELIZABETH: Well, I have an idea.  But what's the story?

ELIZABETH: Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't -- WILLIAM: Oh, so it isn't just my business? ELIZABETH: I'm just saying. WILLIAM: You infuriate me sometimes.  Do you know that?  God. WILLIAM: Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things. ELIZABETH: I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl. WILLIAM: She is not Larry's girl! ELIZABETH: From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you? WILLIAM: I don't know why it is but everytime I reach out for something I- that I want, I have to pull back because I might hurt somebody else.  My whole bloody life; time after time after time. ELIZABETH: Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that WILLIAM: To hell with that! ELIZABETH: Have you asked Annie yet? WILLIAM: I wanted to get this taken care of first. ELIZABETH: Well, what if she feels like your father?  And how do you know she will marry you? WILLIAM: Well, if that's the case, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters it sounds like she has forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me. ELIZABETH: Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women. WILLIAM: So what?  I'm not fast with women. ELIZABETH: Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie.

ELIZABETH: No I don't want a-  Your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  If you marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead. ELIZABETH: Now, what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't. WILLIAM: All right then, mom. ELIZABETH: Just give it some more thought. WILLIAM: I've given it three years of thought.  I had hoped if I waited, dad would've forgotten him by now and we could have a- a regular wedding and everybody happy. WILLIAM: But if that can't happen then I'll just get out. ELIZABETH: What the hell is this? WILLIAM: I'll get out.  I'll go get married someplace else, I- I'll live someplace else, maybe New York. ELIZABETH: Are you crazy? WILLIAM: I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker.  I'm through with it. ELIZABETH: But you have a business here.  What the hell is this? WILLIAM: The business?  The business doesn't inspire me. ELIZABETH: Must you be inspired? WILLIAM: Yeah, I'd like one hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, I'd like to go home to something beautiful.  I'd like a family.  I'd like some kids. WILLIAM: I'd like to build something that's my own.  And Annie is in the center of that.  Now, where do I find it? ELIZABETH: You don't want to think like that. WILLIAM: Well, you help me stay here. ELIZABETH: All right.  But don't think like that because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  All of this, all of it, it's all just for you. WILLIAM: I know that, mom.  Just you help me stay here. ELIZABETH: Don't think like that, do you hear me? WILLIAM: Well, I am thinking like that.

WILLIAM: It seemed to make suckers out of so many guys.  And I-I felt wrong to be alive; to to open that bank book, to to drive that car, the new car, and look at that new refrigerator. I mean, WILLIAM: you can take those things out of the war, but if you're gonna drive that car you've got to know that that came from the love a man can have from a man. And you've got to be a little bit better because of that.  Because if you're not, then it's all just loot and there's blood on it and I didn't want any of it. WILLIAM: And I guess that included you. ELIZABETH: Do you still feel like that? WILLIAM: I want you now, Annie. ELIZABETH: Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris.  Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included. ELIZABETH: And you father, he put hundreds of planes in the air and you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that. WILLIAM: Oh, Annie, ELIZABETH: [LAUGHTER] What will I do with a fortune?

You know, WILLIAM: and all that about flopping around, it's like laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating or something like that. WILLIAM: I mean, this is a big night for these guys.  You know, life's last orgy. ELIZABETH: What are you so excited about.  This isn't rocket science, this is just fish.  Fish nobody even eats. WILLIAM: Yeah, they do. ELIZABETH: Augie.
ELIZABETH: There is no point in coming out here. WILLIAM: Right. ELIZABETH: That's my point. WILLIAM: That's my point, too. ELIZABETH: So let's go. WILLIAM: Oh, no, no, no.  no That's not my point.

WILLIAM: Oh ELIZABETH: it's stupid. WILLIAM: Honey, it's a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this kind of thing only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity. WILLIAM: I mean, Think about people in Kansas, they've got to get like you know plane tickets and hotel reservations just to see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's just too good of an opportunity to pass up. ELIZABETH: Pass what up?  It's It's just little fish and they swim up on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.

WILLIAM: All right.  But they are fish that do something no other fish do.  Like the swallows were turning into Capistrano or Lemmings jumping off the cliffs, you know like that. There's- There's magic here and mystery.  And a little bit of the unexplainable.  You know, I can't see how you could not be interested.

It keeps us thinking that life is gonna start now any minute if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action. WILLIAM: Are we talking about the same thing? ELIZABETH: I'm sorry.  It's just, it's it's just fish to me. WILLIAM: uh, Carla Can I ask you a question?  no, don't get upset, but are you having your period? ELIZABETH: God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting. WILLIAM: What's bugging you then? ELIZABETH: I just - We just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like. WILLIAM: It's not that complicated.  We come down here, the grunions arrive, they do their little fish thing.  We say ooh, awe, look at the little fish.  And then they go home and we go home. ELIZABETH: For God's sake, Augie.  It's- Grow up, we're not going to see the grunion. WILLIAM: Why not? ELIZABETH: We We don't ever.  Have we ever? WILLIAM: We've missed them twice.  That's hardly ever. ELIZABETH: Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever WILLIAM: Well, we'll see them this year. ELIZABETH: No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up.
